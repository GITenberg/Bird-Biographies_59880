<h2 id="c2">FOREWORD</h2>
<p>John Burroughs, in his delightful essay called &ldquo;Birds
and Poets&rdquo; says: &ldquo;The very idea of a bird is a symbol
and a suggestion to the poet. A bird seems to be at the
top of the scale, so vehement and intense is his life&mdash;large
brained, large lunged, hot, ecstatic, his frame
charged with buoyancy and his heart with song. The
beautiful vagabonds, endowed with every grace, masters
of all climes, and knowing no bounds,&mdash;how many human
aspirations are realized in their free, holiday-lives&mdash;and
how many suggestions to the poet in their flight and song.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Long before the place of birds in the great scheme of
nature was understood, they made their appeal: first, to
primitive man, who had curious superstitions and created
beautiful myths concerning them; next, to poets and
dreamers of ancient civilizations, who used them in allusions
beautiful with Oriental imagery; to artists, who delighted
in portraying symbolism; to later poets and lovers
of beauty, who perceived deep truths and revelations of
God; and to scientists, who saw back of the phenomena
of nature the marvelous laws of God.</p>
<p>It is interesting to follow the effect birds have had
upon the development of man. Though the religion of
the early Egyptians was largely worship of the sun and
moon, yet reverence for birds entered into their faith and
their ritual. The swallow, the heron, the hawk, the vulture,
<span class="pb" id="Page_x">x</span>
the goose, and the ibis were all held sacred. The
people of Egypt with their belief in transmigration, imagined
the swallow and the heron as possible abiding-places
for their souls after death.</p>
<p>The Chinese and Japanese have had interesting conceptions
regarding birds that have been both symbolic and
poetic. In Japan, wild ducks, geese, cocks, herons, and
cranes have been highly honored. The people have built
torii gates, or entrances to their temples, as &ldquo;bird-rests&rdquo;
or perches for their sacred fowl.</p>
<p>The Greek and Roman mythologies abound in allusions
to bird-life. It was natural that the powerful eagle should
be held sacred to Jupiter, the lordly peacock to Juno,
the wise owl to Minerva, the repulsive vulture that haunted
battlefields to Mars, the beautiful swan to Apollo, and
the cooing dove to Venus.</p>
<p>The American Indians regarded birds with great reverence.
Their bird-myths are full of beauty. To them the
eagle and the raven were especially sacred.</p>
<p>The dove was a cherished symbol of early Christian
writers and painters. The pelican, too, was revered; it
was the medi&aelig;val symbol of charity. The red breast of
the robin was thought to have been caused by a prick
of a thorn in Christ&rsquo;s crown as the bird strove to &ldquo;wrench
one single thorn away.&rdquo; The red crossbill&rsquo;s beak was
believed to have been twisted in its attempt to remove the
iron nail from Christ&rsquo;s blood-stained hand.</p>
<p class="tb">Burroughs continues: &ldquo;The very oldest poets, the
towering antique bards, seem to make very little mention
of the song-birds. They loved better the soaring, swooping
birds of prey, the eagle, the ominous birds, the vultures,
<span class="pb" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
the storks and cranes, or the clamorous sea-birds
and the screaming hawk. These suited better the rugged,
warlike character of the times, and the simple, powerful
souls of the singers themselves. Homer must have heard
the twittering of the swallows, the cry of the plover, the
voice of the turtle (dove), and the warble of the nightingale;
but they were not adequate symbols to express what
he felt or to adorn his theme. &AElig;schylus saw in the eagle
the &lsquo;dog of Jove,&rsquo; and his verse cuts like a sword with
such a conception.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not because the old bards were less as poets,
but that they were more as men. To strong, susceptible
characters, the music of nature is not confined to sweet
sounds. The defiant scream of the hawk circling aloft,
the wild whinney of the loon, the whooping of the crane,
the booming of the bittern, the loud trumpeting of the
migratory geese sounding down out of the midnight sky,
or the wild crooning of the flocks of gulls&mdash;are much
more welcome in certain moods than any and all mere
bird-melodies, in keeping as they are with the shaggy and
untamed features of ocean and woods, and suggesting
something like Richard Wagner music in the ornithological
orchestra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the life of man grew less warlike and heroic, as the
humbler fireside virtues were honored and the amenities
of life were cultivated, it is true that poets sang of the
gentler, more beautiful aspects of nature. Wordsworth
wrote of the skylark, the cuckoo, and the throstle, Shelley
and Shakespeare of the skylark, Keats of the nightingale
and of goldfinches, Tennyson of the swallow and the
throstle. They were, however, all deeply sensitive to the
wilder phases of nature&mdash;to the scudding cloud, the dashing
<span class="pb" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
spray of the ocean, the raving and moaning of the
tempest. They saw, too, as have many later poets, a
spiritual significance and an inspiration as truly great
and ennobling as the conceptions of the older bards.</p>
<p>Numerous American poets have found spiritual help,
comfort, and inspiration in birds. Frank Bolles felt the
presence of God in the forest where the Oven-bird sings:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Pouring out his spirit&rsquo;s gladness</p>
<p class="t0">Toward the Source of life and being.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Celia Thaxter mused on God&rsquo;s care of man and bird:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;For are we not God&rsquo;s children both,</p>
<p class="t">Thou, little Sandpiper, and I?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Serenity and joy came to Edna Dean Proctor:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;My heart beside the bluebird, sings</p>
<p class="t0">And folds serene its weary wings.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Edward Rowland Sill voiced human need in his poem:</p>
<h4>SPRING TWILIGHT</h4>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Surely thus to sing, Robin,</p>
<p class="t">Thou must have in sight,</p>
<p class="t0">Beautiful skies behind the shower,</p>
<p class="t">And dawn beyond the night.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Would thy faith were mine, Robin!</p>
<p class="t">Then, though night were long</p>
<p class="t0">All its silent hours would melt</p>
<p class="t">Their shadow into song.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Beautiful memories that soothed pain came to Helen
Hunt Jackson at the mere shadow of a bird&rsquo;s wing across
her darkened window. Bird-song bowed Lucy Larcom&rsquo;s
heart in reverence:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xiii">xiii</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Then will the birds sing anthems: for the earth and sky and air</p>
<p class="t0">Will seem a great cathedral, filled with beings dear and fair;</p>
<p class="t0">And long processions, from the time that bluebird notes begin</p>
<p class="t0">Till gentians fade, through forest-aisles will still move out and in.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>All who appreciate Bryant&rsquo;s great poem &ldquo;To a Waterfowl&rdquo;
may see God, not only &ldquo;flying over the hill with the
bird,&rdquo; but as the unfailing guide of the human soul.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">&ldquo;He who, from zone to zone,</p>
<p class="t0">Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight,</p>
<p class="t0">In the long way that I must tread alone,</p>
<p class="t">Will lead my steps aright.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>No more triumphant lines exist in literature than those
in Browning&rsquo;s &ldquo;Paracelsus&rdquo; which express faith in God&rsquo;s
guidance of man and bird:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t2">&ldquo;I go to prove my soul!</p>
<p class="t0">I see my way as birds their trackless way.</p>
<p class="t0">I shall arrive: what time, what circuit first,</p>
<p class="t0">I ask not: but unless God send his hail</p>
<p class="t0">Or blinding fireballs, sleet or stifling snow,</p>
<p class="t0">In some time, his good time, I shall arrive:</p>
<p class="t0">He guides me and the bird.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The poets of the past generations may have written
much about birds, but it is quite probable that they possessed
very little accurate information regarding the service
they render to the world. Longfellow alone has bequeathed
to us, in his beautiful &ldquo;Birds of Killingworth,&rdquo;
a plea for the preservation of birds because of their practical
use to man as well as their &aelig;sthetic and spiritual
value:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xiv">xiv</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Plato, anticipating the Reviewers,</p>
<p class="t">From his Republic banished without pity</p>
<p class="t0">The Poets; in this town of yours,</p>
<p class="t">You put to death, by means of a Committee,</p>
<p class="t0">The ballad-singers and the Troubadours,</p>
<p class="t">The street musicians of the heavenly city,</p>
<p class="t0">The birds, who make sweet music for us all</p>
<p class="t0">In our dark hours, as David did for Saul.</p>
<p class="lc"><span class="gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Think of your woods and orchards without birds!</p>
<p class="t">Of empty nests that cling to boughs and beams</p>
<p class="t0">As in an idiot&rsquo;s brain remembered words</p>
<p class="t">Hang empty &rsquo;mid the cobwebs of his dreams!</p>
<p class="t0">Will bleat of flocks or bellowing of herds</p>
<p class="t">Make up for the lost music, when your teams</p>
<p class="t0">Drag home the stingy harvest, and no more</p>
<p class="t0">The feathered gleaners follow to your door?</p>
<p class="lc"><span class="gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;You call them thieves and pillagers; but know</p>
<p class="t">They are the winged wardens of your farms,</p>
<p class="t0">Who from the cornfields drive the insidious foe,</p>
<p class="t">And from your harvests keep a hundred harms.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>During this past century, the period of scientific investigation,
birds have received a large share of attention.
The immortal pioneers in American Ornithology, Audubon,
Wilson, and Nuttall have been followed by a host of
scientists who have done work of distinction along various
lines. They have described the birds of both fertile and
arid regions, as well as far distant lands, such as Alaska
and the tundra of the North. They have made complete
and valuable collections, the most noted of which are in
the National Museum of Washington and the American
Museum of Natural History in New York. The latter
<span class="pb" id="Page_xv">xv</span>
contains famous Habitat Groups with beautiful backgrounds,
painted by distinguished bird-artists.</p>
<p>Scientists have studied the anatomy of birds, their eggs,
their nests, and nestlings; an army of field-men have been
recording observations on migration, on the molt of birds,
their songs and call-notes, their food habits, especially
with relation to their economic importance. The work
of the Biological Survey in the Department of Agriculture
at Washington has been of incalculable value; the examination
of the contents of birds&rsquo; stomachs has given indisputable
evidence of the relation the different species
bear to insect-life and thus to vegetation. The bulletins
published by the Department and the leaflets issued by the
National Association of Audubon Societies have been
enormous factors in the preservation of bird-life in the
United States.</p>
<p>Dr. A. K. Fisher, Professor F. E. L. Beal, Dr. Sylvester
D. Judd, Dr. C. Hart Merriam, Dr. Henry W. Henshaw,
Dr. E. W. Nelson, Dr. T. S. Palmer, and Dr. Wells T.
Cooke have done work of special distinction in the Biological
Survey, Mr. William Brewster and Mr. E. H. Forbush
in Massachusetts, and Dr. Frank Chapman in New York.</p>
<p>To Dr. Fisher I am especially indebted for the right
to incorporate into this book extracts from the bulletins
of the Biological Survey, and to Mr. Forbush for permission
to quote from his admirable book &ldquo;Useful Birds
and Their Protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has been my purpose to give, not only a portrait
and a description of the birds I have chosen for this
volume, but a summing up of the beneficial and injurious
habits of each, gained from the highest authorities obtainable.
The book is intended for beginners, or for those
<span class="pb" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>
who long to know birds intimately and intelligently, and
wish to belong to the great army of bird-students who are
&ldquo;doing their bit&rdquo; to preserve the bird-life of our country.</p>

<br />OF
<br />OUR COMMON WINTER BIRDS
<br />PART TWO</h2>
<div class="pb" id="Page_1">1</div>
<h1 title="">BIRD BIOGRAPHIES</h1>
<h2 id="c3">WINTER BIRDS
<br /><span class="sc">Permanent Residents
<br />and
<br />Winter Visitors</span></h2>
<p>Most people are surprised to learn that about sixty
species of birds may be seen in the north-central part
of Eastern North America during the winter months.
Many of us, if questioned, would affirm that sparrows,
crows, and jays are the only winter birds to be found.
If some one opens for us the door which leads out into
the great bird-world, we may say, as did the writer of
the old couplet:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I hearing get, who had but ears,</p>
<p class="t0">And sight, who had but eyes before,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>and we may then find, even during the winter season, a
surprising wealth of bird-life to enrich our own.</p>
<p>In spite of wings that will bear them immeasurable distances,
birds seem to have unusual loyalty to their native
haunts, and they stay in the North until hunger impels
them to seek friendlier climes. Those that remain may
be grouped according to the kind of food upon which
they subsist during the winter: first, birds that eat animal
food; second, birds that eat vegetable food; and third,
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
those that eat the eggs or young of insects on tree-trunks
and branches, or chisel them from the wood.</p>
<p>To the first group belong six species of owls and eight
species of hawks, eagles, crows, gulls, shrikes, and about
eight species of ducks. They feed on mice and other
small rodents, on smaller birds and poultry, and on seafood
such as fish, clams, mussels, and scallops.</p>
<p>The birds that live on vegetable food during the winter
are numerous. Throughout the spring and summer
months they may be useful destroyers of insects; but in
winter they are able to subsist on what the woods and
fields yield in the way of nuts, acorns, berries, and the
seeds of grasses and weeds. Such are jays, red-headed
woodpeckers, quail, grouse, and the following members
of the finch or sparrow family: cardinals, pine grosbeaks,
crossbills, goldfinches, snow buntings, juncos, tree sparrows,
white-throated sparrows, redpolls, and pine siskins.
Many of these are permanent residents, but juncos, snow
buntings, tree sparrows, crossbills, pine grosbeaks, and a
few others leave their homes in the far North when deep
snows bury their food supply and resort to less severe
climates. Winter wrens are found in some localities. A
few robins, bluebirds, meadowlarks, and flickers, remain
North during open winters.</p>
<p>The third group of winter birds consists of downy
and hairy woodpeckers, chickadees, tufted titmice,
brown creepers, nuthatches, and golden-crowned kinglets.
They glean insect-eggs from the bark of trees as a large
part of their winter food-supply and form an exceedingly
important group. The enormous number of insect-eggs
eaten by them every year is almost incalculable. Every
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
part of a tree&mdash;the trunk, the large branches, and small
twigs&mdash;is scrutinized by these industrious members of the
Life-Saving Army of our forests.</p>
<p>Dr. Frank Chapman recommends beginning the study
of birds in the winter, while the trees are leafless and the
birds comparatively few in number. People who spread
tables for them are frequently surprised at the number
of species they attract and at the pleasure they experience
in the companionship of their interesting winter visitors.</p>
<h2 id="c4">BIRDS SEEN DURING THE WINTER NEAR NEW YORK CITY<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></h2>
<p>The class of birds called <span class="small">PERMANENT RESIDENTS</span> includes
species which are to be found throughout the year.
Dr. Chapman states that comparatively few species of this
group are permanent residents in the strictest use of the
term. &ldquo;The Bob-white, Ruffed Grouse, and several of
the owls are doubtless literally permanent residents, but it
is not probable that the Bluebirds, for example, found
here during the winter are the same birds which nested
with us in the summer. Doubtless our winter Bluebirds
pass the summer farther north, while our summer Bluebirds
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
winter farther south, but as a species, the Bluebird
is a permanent resident.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 11&frac12; inches; 1&frac12; inch longer than the robin;
tail, over 5 inches long.</p>
<p><b>General Appearance</b>: A <i>crested</i> grayish-blue bird, with <i>bright
blue wings and tail</i>, barred and tipped with black
and white. In flight, the long tail is conspicuous;
it resembles a pointed fan.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: Grayish-blue above, grayish-white below,
lighter on throat and belly. Head with a conspicuous
crest; forehead black; bill long, strong, and
black. A black band that extends back of the crest
and encircles the throat is widest across the breast.

<p class="caption">BLUE JAY</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>This brilliant, handsome blue-coat never &ldquo;hides his
light under a bushel&rdquo;; his noisy <i>jay-jay</i> always
proclaims his presence. He would at times be unendurable,
except that he never remains long in one place; he
is on the leap constantly, with a dash and an impudent
assurance that is amusing.</p>
<p>He is the &ldquo;bad boy&rdquo; of the bird neighborhood, the terror
of the small birds. They seem to have the same fear
of him that children have of a great bully. He swoops
down upon them, worries and frightens them, robs their
nests, and brings to his own spoiled fledglings eggs and
young as tidbits.</p>
<p>He is a devoted husband and father, who shows his
best traits in his family circle. He reminds one of certain
human beings who take excellent care of their own,
but who are neither good neighbors nor desirable citizens.
Occasionally, however, he has family differences. My
sister tells of watching a jay bring twig after twig for nest-building
to his mate, who was evidently in a bad mood.
She would have none of them; she seized each twig and
threw it away with a disagreeable <i>y&#259;h, y&#259;h</i>. After repeated
attempts, he gave it up and both flew away. My
sister never learned what occurred later.</p>
<p>The jay is an inveterate tease. He delights in annoying
poor half-blind owls in the day-time, by pecking at
them from unexpected quarters. An owl has been known
to seize the Tormentor and speedily put an end to his
existence.</p>
<p>The blue jay is a member of the same family to which
the crow belongs, and while totally different in appearance,
resembles him in his cleverness, his fearlessness,
and his audacious insolence. Dr. Henshaw, formerly of
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
the Biological Survey in Washington, brings the following
accusation against this bird:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The blue jay is of a dual nature. Cautious and silent
in the vicinity of its nest, away from it, it is bold and
noisy. Sly in the commission of mischief, it is ever ready
to scream &lsquo;thief&rsquo; at the slightest disturbance. As usual
in such cases, its remarks are applicable to none more
than itself, a fact neighboring nest-holders know to their
sorrow, for during the breeding season the jay lays heavy
toll upon the eggs and young of other birds, and in doing
so deprives us of the services of species more beneficial
than itself.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Mr. E. R. Kalmbach, also of the Biological Survey,
says that in winter jays eat the eggs of the tent caterpillar,
and the larv&aelig; of the brown-tail moth, besides waste grain,
and &ldquo;mast,&rdquo;&mdash;the name given to vegetable food such as
acorns, beechnuts, chestnuts, hazelnuts, etc. It likes pecans
and cultivated fruit in their season&mdash;two other points
against the bird. The wild fruits it selects are of no
economic value.</p>
<p>Mr. Kalmbach concludes: &ldquo;The blue jay probably
renders its best service to man in destroying grasshoppers
late in the season and in feeding on hibernating insects
and their eggs, as they do in the case of the tent caterpillar
and brown-tail moth. Beetles and weevils of various
kinds also fall as their prey. The severest criticism
against the species is the destruction of other birds and
their eggs. Where we wish to attract the latter in large
numbers about our dooryards, in our parks, and in game
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
preserves, it will be well not to allow the jay to become
too abundant.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Wilson Flagg says: &ldquo;The blue jay is a true American.
He is known throughout the continent and never visits any
other country. At no season is he absent from our woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has a beautiful outward appearance, under which
he conceals an unamiable temper and a propensity to
mischief. There is no bird in our forest that is arrayed
in equal splendor. But with all his beauty, he has, like
the peacock, a harsh voice. He is a sort of Ishmael
among the feathered tribes, who are startled at the sound
of his voice and fear him as a bandit. There is no music
in his nature; he is fit only for &lsquo;stratagems and spoils.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is an industrious consumer of the larger insects
and grubs, atoning in this way for some of his evil deeds.
I cannot say, therefore, that I would consent to his banishment,
for he is one of the most cheering tenants of the
grove at a season when they have but few inhabitants.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a></p>
<h3>FLORIDA JAYS</h3>
<p>Two species of jays are found in Florida. One, called
the <span class="small">FLORIDA BLUE JAY</span>, resembles its northern relative, except
that it is somewhat smaller (10&frac12; inches), is less
brilliant in color, and has narrower, less conspicuous white
tips to its feathers. These jays frequent live-oak trees.
A flock of six or eight on the ground searching for acorns,
is pleasing to the eye, but not to the ear.</p>
<p>A second species is called the <span class="small">FLORIDA JAY</span>. The top
and sides of its head are a <i>grayish-blue</i>; its neck, wings,
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
and tail are a <i>brighter blue</i>; <i>its back is a grayish-brown</i>;
its under parts are gray, washed with brown, and faintly
streaked on throat and breast. Its breast-band is <i>bluish</i>.
This jay is found chiefly along the southern coast of Florida.
The <i>absence of a crest</i> is its most distinguishing
mark.</p>
<h3>PACIFIC COAST JAYS</h3>
<p>Two species of jays are common in California and its
neighboring states. One, the <span class="small">STELLER JAY</span>, enjoys a good
reputation. It differs from its better-known relatives in
appearance, also. Its <i>head</i>, <i>crest</i>, <i>throat</i>, <i>breast</i>, and <i>back</i>
are a <i>brownish-black</i>; its <i>belly</i> and <i>rump</i> are <i>light
blue</i>, its wings and tail purplish-blue, barred with
black.</p>
<p>It is a shy bird and does not often approach the haunts
of man. Its food is very like that of other jays, but its
habits bring no condemnation upon it.<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a></p>
<p>The <span class="small">CALIFORNIA JAY</span> is similar to the Florida Jay and
may be easily distinguished by its blue head <i>without a
crest</i>, its blue neck, wings, and tail, its brown back, white
throat, and gray under parts. This jay is a decided reprobate.
Professor Beal has characterized it as follows:
&ldquo;It freely visits the stockyards near ranch buildings, and
orchards and gardens. As a fruit stealer it is notorious.
One instance is recorded where seven jays were shot from
a prune tree, one after the other, the dead bodies being
left under the tree until all were killed. So eager were
the birds to get the fruit that the report of the gun and
the sight of their dead did not deter them from coming
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
to the tree. In orchards, in canyons, or on hillsides adjacent
to chaparral or other cover, great mischief is done
by this bird. In one such case an orchard was under observation
at a time when the prune crop was ripening,
and jays in a continuous stream were seen to come down
a small ravine to the orchard, prey upon the fruit, and
return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fruit stealing, however, is only one of the sins of the
California jay. That it robs hens&rsquo; nests is universal testimony.
A case is reported of a hen having a nest under
a clump of bushes; every day a jay came to a tree a
few rods away, and when it heard the cackle of the hen
announcing a new egg it flew at once to the nest. At
the same time the mistress of the house hastened to the
spot to secure the prize, but in most cases the jay won the
race. This is only one of many similar cases recounted.
The jays have learned just what the cackle of the hen
means. Another case more serious is that related by a
man engaged in raising white leghorn fowls on a ranch
several miles from a canyon. He stated that when the
chicks were very young the jays attacked and killed them
by a few blows of the beak and then pecked open the
skull and ate out the brains. In spite of all efforts to
protect the chicks and kill the jays, the losses in this
way were serious.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a></p>
<h3>THE CANADA JAY</h3>
<p>The <span class="small">CANADA JAY</span> is similar in form and size to its blue
relatives, but has the coloring of a northern winter landscape&mdash;gray,
black, and white. This jay has no crest;
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
the back of its head and nape are black; the forehead
and neck are white; the upper parts are gray, with darker
gray wings and tail; under parts, light gray; tail, long;
plumage, fluffy and fur-like.</p>
<p>This bird is found in the forests of Canada and in
the northern part of the United States, where it is most
common in the coniferous forests of Maine and Minnesota,
in the wilder parts of the White and Green Mts.,
and in the Adirondacks.</p>
<p>Major Charles Bendire, in his interesting &ldquo;Life Histories
of American Birds,&rdquo; published by our government,
writes the following amusing account of the Canada jay:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No bird is better known to the lumbermen, trappers
and hunters along our northern border than the Canada
Jay, which is a constant attendant at their camps, and affords
them no little amusement during the lonely hours
spent in the woods. To one not familiar with these birds
it is astonishing how tame they become.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Manly Hardy writes: &lsquo;The Canada Jay is a constant
resident of northern Maine, but in some seasons
they are far more abundant than in others, being usually
found in companies of from three to ten. They are the
boldest of all our birds, except the Chickadee, and in
cool impudence far surpass all others. They will enter
tents, and often alight on the bow of a canoe where the
paddle at every stroke comes within 18 inches of them.
I know of nothing which can be eaten that they will not
take, and I had one steal all my candles, pulling them out
endwise one by one from a piece of birch bark they were
rolled in, and another pecked a large hole in a cake of
castile soap. A duck which I had picked and laid down
for a few minutes had the entire breast eaten out by
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
one or more of these birds. I have seen one alight in
the middle of my canoe and peck away at the carcass
of a beaver I had skinned. They often spoil deer saddles
by pecking into them near the kidneys. They do
great damage to the trappers by stealing the bait from
traps set for martens and minks and by eating trapped
game; they will spoil a marten in a short time. They
will sit quietly and see you build a log trap and bait it,
and then, almost before your back is turned, you hear
their hateful <i>ca-ca-ca</i> as they glide down and peer into
it. They will work steadily carrying off meat and hiding
it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<h2>THE AMERICAN CROW
<br /><i>Crow Family&mdash;Corvid&aelig;</i></h2>
<p>The <span class="small">AMERICAN CROW</span> is too well-known to need a
description&mdash;merely a reference to the steely-blue
or dark purple sheen of his &ldquo;crow-black&rdquo; plumage, and
to the remarkable power of his long (twelve-inch) wings,
which in flight show feather finger-tips at their ends.</p>
<p>One cannot but admire his strength and his absolute
fearlessness, nor fail to be amused at his cleverness and
his insolent bravado. Two or three crows, cawing
hoarsely, will people a woodland in winter; while a flock,
winging its way to the naked March woods, will cause a
thrill of joy and expectancy, in spite of the knowledge
that the advent of these black marauders means eternal
vigilance to long-suffering farmers.</p>
<p>Dr. Sylvester D. Judd at Marshall Hall, Maryland,
made an exhaustive study of the crow&rsquo;s food habits. He
reported the following:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crow is by all means the worst pilferer of the
cornfield. Every year at Marshall Hall, as elsewhere,
a part of the field must be replanted because of his &lsquo;pickings
and stealings.&rsquo; In 1899, the replanting was more
extensive than usual&mdash;46 per cent. of the 3&frac12; bushels
originally planted. This unusual ratio was probably
caused by the failure of the cherry crop, which left the
crow short of food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Judd told of the &ldquo;protective devices of tarring
corn,&rdquo; which did not prevent the crows from pulling up
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
the grain in large quantities, though they did not eat it.
He continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The injury to corn at other seasons than sprouting time
is, as a general thing, comparatively insignificant, but
in some years it has been important when the ears were
in the milk. They then tear open the ears, and pick out
the kernels in rapid succession. In the National Zo&ouml;logical
Park at Washington during the summer of 1896,
their depredations on an acre of corn were watched, and
50 per cent. of the crop was found to have been ruined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only scarecrows that proved effective at Marshall
Hall were dead crows, and strings stretched on poles
around the field and hung with long white streamers.
Although in fall the number of marauders is greatly increased
by re&euml;nforcements from the North, ripe corn sustains
less injury from crows than roasting ears. One
reason is the abundance of fall fruit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wheat suffers comparatively little. When it is ripening,
cherries and sprouting corn divert the crow&rsquo;s attention.
After it is cut and gathered into the shock, however,
they often join the English sparrows in removing the
kernels. Oats are injured even less than wheat, though
crows have been noticed feeding on them at harvest
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the crow is considered the arch-criminal of the
bird-world, Dr. Judd ascribed to him a good habit&mdash;that
of the dissemination of wild seeds in an unusual manner.
He wrote: &ldquo;In November, 1899, a large flock on the
wing was noticed in the distance, at a point opposite Fort
Washington, several miles above Marshall Hall. They
came on down the river in a line that at times stretched
almost from one bank to the other. They circled several
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
times and alighted on the shore. The flock numbered at
least a thousand, and hoarse caws and croaks gave evidence
that it was made up to some extent of fish crows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the birds had remained on shore about fifteen
minutes, they were put to flight by a farmer&rsquo;s boy and
flew on down the river. Going to the place where they
had alighted, I found the sandy beach cut up for more
than a hundred yards with their tracks. Many led out
to the water, and floating black feathers here and there
showed where baths had been taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most interesting trace of their sojourn, however,
was several hundred pellets of fruit material, which they
had ejected through their mouths and dropped on the
ground. These pellets were about an inch in length and
half an inch in diameter. They were of a deep purplish
color, due to the fruit of woodbine, wild grape, and pokeberry,
of which they were mainly composed. In 50 pellets
collected there were only 11 seeds of other plants&mdash;namely,
holly, bitter-sweet, and poison ivy. Pokeberry
seeds were by far the most numerous. Mr. A. J. Pieters,
of the Botanical Division of the Department of Agriculture,
germinated some of them, thus demonstrating the
fact that they were distributed uninjured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pellets were made up not only of seeds and skins,
but largely of fruit pulp in an undigested state. It seems
strange that the birds should have rid themselves of a substance
that still contained a good deal of nutriment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little is known of the distribution of fruit seeds by
crows during migration, but it is certain that they do this
work effectively while they fly to and from the roosts where
they congregate in winter, for their feeding grounds often
cover an area stretching out on all sides from the roosts
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
for 50 miles or more. It appears highly probable that
the crows which are found in winter at Marshall Hall
roost at Woodbridge, D. C., some 15 miles distant.
There, in the midst of several acres of woodland, a crow
dormitory is established, in which probably 100,000 crows
sleep every winter night. It was visited in February,
1901, and the ground was found to be strewn with disgorged
pellets.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a></p>
<p>The <span class="small">FISH CROW</span> (16 inches long) is three inches smaller
than the common crow. It has a more uniform iridescence
above, and is greenish underneath. Its caw is
hoarser and more nasal. Its range is from Connecticut
and the lower Hudson southward, generally near the coast.
It is abundant in Virginia, and near the city of Washington.</p>
<p>The <span class="small">FLORIDA CROW</span> is similar to the American Crow,
except that its bill and feet are larger, its wings and tail
shorter.</p>
<h3>THE RAVEN</h3>
<p>The <span class="small">NORTHERN RAVEN</span> so resembles the crow that it is
often difficult to distinguish them. The chief differences
are the raven&rsquo;s much greater size (from 22 to 26&frac12; inches),
and its note, which sounds more like <i>Croak</i> than
<i>Caw</i>. This is the raven found in Alaska, northern Canada,
and Greenland,&mdash;the bird especially revered by Alaskan
Indians. It is found also in the northern United
States,&mdash;in the state of Washington, in Minnesota, the
Adirondacks, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Major Charles Bendire, in his &ldquo;Life Histories of North
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
American Birds,&rdquo; makes the following statements about
the northern raven:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It lives to a great extent on offal and refuse of any
kind, and is generally most abundant in the immediate
vicinity of Indian camps and settlements, which are mostly
located on the seashore, or on the banks of the larger
rivers in the interior where these birds act as scavengers.
Hundreds of ravens may frequently be seen in the vicinity
of the salmon-canning stations. Clams also form a
part of their food; these are said to be carried some distance
in the air and dropped on the rocks to break their
shells. They also prey to no small extent on the young
and eggs of different water-fowl.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">CARDINAL</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h2>THE CARDINAL
<br /><span class="sc">Cardinal Grosbeak</span>, <span class="sc">Redbird</span>, <span class="sc">Virginia Nightingale</span></h2>
<p>(<i>Cardinals belong to the Grosbeak group of the large Finch or Sparrow Family, or the Fringillid&aelig;.</i>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 8&frac14; inches; slightly smaller than the robin.</p>
<p><b>General Appearance</b>: Brilliant rose-red plumage; crested head
and thick beak.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: A soft cardinal red, except for a black throat, a black
band encircling bill, and, in winter, a grayish tinge
to wings. Bill large, heavy, and light red. Red
crest conspicuous; it may be raised and lowered at
will. Tail long and slender; it is twitched nervously
and frequently.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Brownish-gray above, yellowish underneath. Crest,
wings, and tail reddish&mdash;the color especially noticeable
in flight. Throat and band about bill grayish-black.</p>
<p><b>Call-note</b>: A sharp, insistent <i>tsip, tsip</i>.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A loud and clear, yet sweet and mellow whistle, <i>cheer,
cheer, he-u, he-u, he-u</i>, repeatedly rapidly with descending
inflection, and with nearly an octave in
range. The female, unlike most of her sex in the
bird-world, is also a fine singer; her soft melodious
warble is considered by many listeners to be superior
to the song of her mate.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: &ldquo;Shrubbery is its chosen haunt, the more tangled the
better. Here the nest is built and here they spend
most of their days. Higher trees are usually sought
only under the inspiration of song.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p><b>Range</b>: From southeastern South Dakota, Iowa, northern Indiana
and Ohio, southeastern and southwestern Pennsylvania,
southern Hudson Valley, south to the Gulf
States; a resident of Bermuda. Cardinals are not
migratory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cardinals are especially numerous in our Southern
States. They abound in Florida and Bermuda,
where their brilliant coloring contrasts wonderfully with
the light sands and the coral limestone. A cardinal singing
in an hibiscus bush, laden with gorgeous red blooms,
makes a never-to-be-forgotten memory; while a sight of
one in a blossoming Virginia dog-wood tree or against a
northern snow-scene is equally memorable. These birds
are great favorites in the South, rivaling the mockingbirds
in the affections of many people. In the North, a glimpse
of a cardinal marks a red-letter day; and bird-lovers whose
kind hands spread bountiful tables for winter residents,
count themselves highly favored to have a pair of cardinals
for their guests. Aside from the joy which their
beauty and their song bring, they possess great practical
value.</p>
<p>Mr. W. L. McAtee, of the Biological Survey, writes that
about one-fourth of the cardinal&rsquo;s food consists of destructive
pests such as the worms which infest cotton plants,
and numerous other caterpillars, besides grasshoppers,
scale insects, beetles, and others. A large part of their
food consists of the seeds of troublesome weeds and of
wild fruits. &ldquo;The bird has a record for feeding on many
of the worst agricultural pests.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> No sins are laid at
his door. &ldquo;Cardinals are usually seen in pairs, but in
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
winter they often collect in southern swamps and thickets,
and flock to feeding-places near the haunts of man when
food is scarce.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a></p>
<p>They were formerly trapped for cage-birds. They
were so highly esteemed that they were in great demand
even in Europe, where they received the name of the &ldquo;Virginia
Nightingale.&rdquo; But trapping is now nearly abolished,
and the wild, liberty-loving cardinal may roam as
he will with the wife of his heart. Few birds are more
ardent, jealous lovers, more tenderly devoted husbands,
or more anxious, solicitous fathers than these beautiful,
sweet-voiced redbirds.<a class="fn" href="#fn_12">[12]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<h2>THE PINE GROSBEAK
<br /><i>Finch Family&mdash;Fringillid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: A little over 9 inches; slightly larger than his cousin,
the cardinal, and nearly an inch smaller than the
robin.</p>
<p><b>General Appearance</b>: A <i>red bird</i> with <i>brown and white wings,
a brown tail, and a heavy beak</i>.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: A bright raspberry-red, deepest on the <i>head</i>, <i>breast</i>,
<i>rump</i>, and <i>upper tail-coverts</i>; the rest of the body a
slaty gray, lighter underneath, with a <i>soft red breast</i>;
wings dark brown, edged with white, forming two
broad wing-bars; tail forked; beak large and strong,
with a small hook at the end.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Slaty gray, with head, rump, and upper tail-coverts
<i>olive-yellow</i> where the male&rsquo;s are red; under parts
washed with yellow: wings and tail brown; wings
edged with white; two wing-bars.</p>
<p><b>Young</b>: Similar to female.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A loud, clear whistle, given while on the wing. In
spring, a melodious nesting song.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern North America. Breeds in the tree-regions of
Canada, in the White Mts., and Maine; winters south
to Iowa, Indiana, Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey,
(and occasionally to the District of Columbia and
Kentucky), westward to Manitoba, Minnesota, and
Kansas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This brilliant, handsome Pine Grosbeak is comparatively
unknown in the United States, but wherever
he appears as a rare visitor, he is hailed with enthusiasm
or excitement because of his beautiful color. He resembles
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
his cousin, the purple finch, in color and markings,
but is much larger.</p>
<p>Thoreau says, &ldquo;When some rare northern bird like the
pine grosbeak is seen thus far south in the winter, he does
not suggest poverty, but dazzles us with his beauty.
There is in them a warmth akin to the warmth that melts
the icicle. Think of these brilliant, warm-colored, and
richly-warbling birds, birds of paradise, dainty-footed,
downy-clad, in the midst of a New England, a Canadian
winter.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a></p>
<p>The Pine Grosbeak &ldquo;is of gentle, unobtrusive manner,
almost entirely fearless of man&rsquo;s approach, and always
seems to be perfectly contented with its situation wherever
encountered. A whole tree full of these birds may
be seen feeding on the seeds of mountain ash berries, apples,
or the buds of beeches. One may stand within a few
feet of them for a long time without their taking any notice
of one&rsquo;s presence. They are slow and deliberate in
manner. Their flight, however, is rather rapid and aggressive,
slightly undulating.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a></p>
<p>They are silent, uninteresting birds, awkward in their
movements. They are very hardy, and roam southward
when the severe Canadian winters send them forth in search
of food. Seeds of cone-bearing trees, sumac and mountain
ash berries are their favorite winter diet. They return
to their northern nesting places when few birds would
consider it seemly to set up housekeeping.</p>

<p><b>General Appearance</b>: A small, plump red bird, with brown
wings, brown forked tail, and a <i>bill crossed at the

<p>Red Crossbills are truly the &ldquo;Wandering Jews&rdquo;
of the bird-world. They are erratic nomads, living
in flocks, and roaming where fancy leads or necessity
impels them. They pitch their tents and raise their
broods wherever they may happen to be sojourning in late
winter or early spring, even though many miles south of
their natural breeding places. Dr. Elliot Coues writes:
&ldquo;Their most remarkable habit is that of breeding in the
winter, or very early in the spring, when one would think
it impossible that their callow young could endure the
rigors of the season.&rdquo; He mentions a nest taken in Maine
in February, and another in Vermont so early in March
that the ground was covered with snow and the weather
was very severe.<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a></p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>They make no regular migrations, spring or fall, but
like will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps appear and vanish, affording one of
the most delightful surprises to be found in nature. To
see one of them, accompanied by his olive-green mate,
swinging from a spruce bough against a flaming sunset
sky or a snowy landscape, is an event in one&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Crossbills are denizens of coniferous forests. Their
twisted or crossed bills are peculiarly adapted to extracting
seeds from pine and spruce cones, though they eat
berries, fruit, grass seeds, and cankerworms in season.
Because of their curiously twisted beaks, these birds have
always been regarded with peculiar interest, even with
superstition. Longfellow has preserved for us the German
legend regarding this bird in his poem:</p>
<h3>THE LEGEND OF THE CROSSBILL</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">On the cross the dying Saviour</p>
<p class="t">Heavenward lifts his eyelids calm,</p>
<p class="t0">Feels, but scarcely feels, a trembling</p>
<p class="t">In his pierced and bleeding palm.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And by all the world forsaken,</p>
<p class="t">Sees He how with zealous care</p>
<p class="t0">At the ruthless nail of iron</p>
<p class="t">A little bird is striving there.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Stained with blood and never tiring</p>
<p class="t">With its beak it doth not cease;</p>

<h3>THE WHITE-WINGED CROSSBILL</h3>
<p>The White-winged Crossbill is similar to the Red Crossbill,
but its body is a <i>dull crimson instead of red</i>, and its
black wing-feathers are so tipped with white as to form
<i>two broad white wing-bars</i>. The female is olive-green,
gray underneath, with a yellow rump, dark wings and tail,
white wing-bars, and dark streaks on head, breast, and
back.</p>
<p>This crossbill breeds in Canada, south to the Adirondacks,
White Mountains, and Maine. Its note is a soft
<i>cheep</i>; its song a gentle warble. To see a flock of these
birds feeding silently in a grove of spruces or hear them
singing their low sweet song makes a memory cherished
by bird-lovers. They may be seen in winter as far south
as North Carolina.</p>

<h2>THE JUNCO OR SLATE-COLORED SNOWBIRD
<br /><i>Finch Family&mdash;Fringillid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 6&frac14; inches; slightly smaller than the English
sparrow.</p>
<p><b>General Appearance</b>: Trim, dainty little birds, all gray and
white, except for a <i>pinkish</i> or <i>flesh-colored</i> bill.
<i>White outer tail-feathers</i>, showing in flight, are distinguishing
marks.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Dark slate-gray above and white below. The gray extends
to the center of the breast in a nearly horizontal
line, and with the white under parts, gives the
effect of the birds&rsquo; having waded breast-deep in the
snow, or having been sliced in two, like the &ldquo;sliced
animals&rdquo; of our childhood. Sides grayish; wings
slightly darker; tail dark brown, with two outer
feathers white; third feather, partly white; bill heavy,
adapted to a diet of seeds.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Similar to male, only brownish-gray. Winter plumage
of all juncos browner than summer plumage.</p>
<p><b>Young</b>: Light brownish, streaked with black.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: A gentle <i>tseep, tseep</i>, and a <i>smack, smack</i>, of alarm or
distress.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A tender, sweet trill in the spring. Though monotonous,
the song is very pleasing.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Groves of conifers; thickets of bushes or vines, or
clumps of weeds.</p>
<p><b>Nest</b>: Juncos&rsquo; nests are built of mosses or grasses on or near
the ground. The speckled eggs and the streaked
babies are excellent examples of protective coloring.
The nests are sometimes placed very near houses, if
the surroundings are to the liking of the birds.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern and northern North America. Breeds from
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
the tree-limit of Alaska and Canada southward to
northern United States,&mdash;northern Minnesota, central
Michigan, Maine, the mountains of New York, Pennsylvania,
and Massachusetts; winters throughout eastern
United States and southern Canada to the Gulf
Coast.</p>
<p class="bq">The Carolina Junco, nesting in the southern Appalachian
mountains, is a subspecies, differing but very
slightly in color.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Juncos are gentle, attractive little creatures that come
to our thickets when the chill of autumn has driven
away our insectivorous birds. Being seed-eaters, they do
not fear winter snows, except those that cover tall weeds.
According to Professor Beal, juncos should be rigidly protected.
They not only destroy large quantities of weed
seeds, thereby rendering service to agriculture, but they
eat harmful insects, of which caterpillars are their favorite.
They do no damage to fruit or grain.<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Forbush writes of the junco as follows: &ldquo;The
Snowbird does not often breed in Massachusetts, excepting
on the higher lands of the north-central and western parts
of the State. Pairs are said to nest occasionally in ice-houses,
which are certainly cool, if not suitable situations.
It is a bird of the Canadian fauna, and it winters in Massachusetts
whenever conditions are favorable. In the
southeastern portion of the State, where the ground is
bare in sheltered places through much of the winter, or
where weed seed, chaff, and other food can be secured,
this bird is common in the colder months. Its notes at this
season are chiefly sparrow like chirps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;A flock of these dark birds on the new-fallen snow is
an interesting sight on a cold winter&rsquo;s day, as they come
familiarly about the house or barnyard. Audubon says
that in winter they burrow in stacks of corn or hay for
shelter at night during the continuance of inclement
weather. As spring comes they begin to sing much like
the Chipping Sparrow. They converse together with a
musical twittering, and about the first of May they leave
for their northern breeding-ground.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a></p>

<h2>THE SNOWFLAKE OR SNOW BUNTING
<br /><i>Finch Family&mdash;Fringillid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: A little less than 7 inches; slightly larger than the
junco and the English sparrow.</p>
<p><b>General Appearance</b>: A brown, black, and white bird; the
<i>white is conspicuous on wings and tail</i>, especially in
flight. The bird has a characteristic way of &ldquo;hugging
the ground&rdquo; when walking or running&mdash;it does
not hop.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: <i>In winter</i>: head brown on top, lighter on
neck; white on sides of head, with a brown thumb-mark
below eye; back brown, streaked with black;
throat and belly white; a broad brownish band across
breast; a brownish wash on sides and rump; wings
black and white, some of the feathers edged with
brown&mdash;in flight, the wings appear white, broadly
tipped with black; inner tail-feathers black, outer
feathers white. <i>In summer</i>: back and shoulders
black, the rest of the body white; wings and tail
black and white.</p>
<p><b>Notes</b>: Thoreau calls their note &ldquo;a rippling whistle.&rdquo; He says
also, &ldquo;Besides their rippling note, they have a vibratory
twitter, and from the loiterers you hear quite
a tender peep.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a></p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: The tundras of North America. Snow buntings breed
in the treeless regions of the North; they migrate
southward during the winter.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Northern Hemisphere. In North America, they breed
from 83&deg; north (including Greenland), to the northern
part of Canada and Alaska; winter from
Unalaska and south-central Canada to northern
United States, irregularly to northern California,
Colorado, Kansas, southern Indiana and Ohio, and
Florida.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/i061.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="719" />
<p class="caption">SNOWFLAKE</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Snow Buntings, or &ldquo;Brown Snowbirds&rdquo; as they are
called to distinguish them from the juncos, or &ldquo;Gray
Snowbirds,&rdquo; are not generally known because of the infrequency
and irregularity of their visits. They belong to
the Sparrow family, but have so much black and white on
their wings and tail as to appear very unlike their relatives.</p>
<p>Snowflakes are gentle, fearless little birds, possibly because
they come from the sparsely settled regions of the
North, where they need not learn to fear human beings.
Like chickadees, they appear to love driving storms, and to
frolic during February blizzards with as keen delight as
warmly clad children; like tree sparrows, they are protected
by a layer of fat that keeps out the cold. As they,
too, are seed-eaters, snow buntings must journey southward
during the winter to regions where deep snows do not bury
the weeds.</p>
<p>Few people are aware that in the treeless plains of the
north there lives a bird that resembles the much-admired
skylark of England in its way of singing. Both snow
buntings and skylarks begin to sing as they rise from the
ground, sing while on the wing or high up in the air, then
drop swiftly to the ground.</p>
<p>Dr. Judd writes as follows about the snowbird: &ldquo;The
snowflake is a bird of the arctic tundra, above the limit of
tree growth. In North America it breeds about Hudson
Bay, in the northernmost parts of Labrador and Alaska, and
to the northward. In its northern home it is a white,
black-blotched sparrow, of whose habits very little is
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
known, except that it makes a feather-lined nest on the
ground, in which it rears four or five young on a diet
which probably consists principally of insects. After the
breeding season, however, a buffy brown comes mixed
with the black and white, and the birds assume a more
sparrowlike aspect. They migrate southward with the
first severe cold weather, some of them coming as far south
as the northern half of the United States, where their appearance
is regarded as a sure sign that winter has begun in
earnest. Often a flock of a thousand will come with a
blizzard, the thermometer registering 30&deg; to 40&deg; below
zero; and in their circling, swirling flight, as they are
borne along by the blast, they might well be mistaken at a
distance for veritable snowflakes. They settle in the open
fields and along railroad tracks, where they secure some
food from hayseed, grain that has sifted out of the grain
cars, and seeds of weeds that grow along the tracks. Here
they remain until April, when, in obedience to the migrating
instinct, they journey north to nest on the treeless
plains of the arctic regions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The snowflake differs from many other winter sparrows,
such as the tree sparrow, junco, and white-throated
sparrow, in that its flocks act more nearly as units, the
alarm of a single member causing the whole flock to whirl
up into the air and be off. A further difference may be
noted in its strictly terrestrial habits. When not flying, it
is almost invariably found on the ground; and when it
does happen to alight in a tree, awkward wobblings betray
its discomfort. Where the feeding conditions are favorable,
immense flocks of snowflakes may be seen apparently
rolling like a cloud across the land, this curious effect being
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
due to the rear rank continually rising and flying forward
to a point just in advance of the rest of the flock.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a></p>
<p>Dr. Judd says that little information can be given concerning
the summer food of this bird, but that it probably
feeds on the seeds of shore or marsh plants. The winter
food consists of grain, mostly gleanings or waste, and of
weed seed which is consumed in enormous quantities.
&ldquo;On account of its good work as a weed destroyer and the
apparent absence of any noticeably detrimental food habits,
the snowflake seems to deserve high commendation, and
should receive careful protection.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="t">Back to the North they fly.</p>
</div>
<p>Such are the rollicking little Tree Sparrows, that whirl
into our vision like an eddy of brown leaves. To
the untrained observer, they are &ldquo;just sparrows,&rdquo; but to
the &ldquo;seeing eye&rdquo; they are altogether more dainty and refined
than English sparrows, and have different markings.
Their little brown caps, the gray line over their bright
eyes, their brown backs, white wing-bars, pale gray breasts
and forked tails resemble those of their little cousins, the
chipping sparrows. But <i>the soft grayish-black spot on
each</i> tree sparrow&rsquo;s breast is a difference. Careful comparison
with the &ldquo;Chippy&rdquo; will show no straight black line
extending from the eye, but a brown curve behind the eye
that joins the one extending from the bill.</p>
<p>The voices of winter chippies are infinitely sweeter than
those of the door yard chippies and their English relatives.
Their note is sweet and joyous. Mr. Forbush writes of
their song as follows: &ldquo;Tree Sparrows are among the
few birds that can &lsquo;look our winters in the face and sing.&rsquo;
They are occasionally heard singing in November and December
and late in February, when deep snow covers the
ground. The song is among the sweetest of sparrow notes,
but not very strong. It slightly resembles that of the Fox
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
Sparrow. Like other sparrows they chirp and twitter
from time to time, but the full chorus of a flock in winter
is a sound worth going far to hear.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a></p>
<p>Dr. Judd says: &ldquo;The tree sparrow breeds in Labrador
and the Hudson Bay region and westward to Alaska. In
the fall the birds come down from the north in immense
throngs and spread over the United States as far south as
South Carolina, Kansas, and Arizona. During the winter,
in company with juncos, white-throats, white-crowns, and
fox sparrows, they give life to the hedgerows, tangled
thickets, and weed patches.... The food of the tree
sparrow during its stay in the United States is almost entirely
made up of seeds. The bird shows an essential
difference from its associates, however, in its large consumption
of grass seed, fully half of its food consisting of
this element.... Nearly two-thirds of the vegetable food
that is not grass seed is derived from such plants as ragweed,
amaranth, lamb&rsquo;s quarters, ... and a variety of
seeds such as wild sunflower, goldenrod, chickweed, purslane,
wood sorrel, violet, and sheep sorrel.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a></p>
<p>Professor Beal says that the oily seeds of such plants
as ragweed cause the little bodies of tree sparrows to be
encased in &ldquo;a layer of fat constituting a set of under-flannels
from one-eighth to one-fourth of an inch in thickness
all over the bird&rsquo;s body.&rdquo; They are so warmly dressed
that it is no wonder they are happy, cheerful, and active.
A sight of them in a beautiful, snowy meadow is enough
to repay one for the trouble of a quest.</p>

<h2>THE BOBWHITE OR QUAIL
<br /><i>American Partridge Family&mdash;Odontophorid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 10 inches; the same length as the robin, but
the quail has a stouter body and a shorter tail.</p>
<p><b>General Appearance</b>: A plump, mottled brown bird, with a
small head, short bill, and short tail.</p>
<p><b>Male:</b> Upper parts reddish-brown and chestnut-brown, mottled
with black, gray, and buff; head slightly crested;
<i>forehead and line above eye white</i>, line extending to
neck; black patch below eye, that curves to enclose
<i>white throat</i> and forms a band below it; under parts
whitish, barred with black, except upper part of
breast which is reddish-brown; tail short, gray, mottled
with buff and a few black flecks.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Similar to male, except for <i>buff patch over eye and
buff throat</i>, and less black on head, neck, and
across breast. In summer, the crown of both sexes
is darker than in winter; the buff markings are lighter
in color.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: <i>Bob-white? Bob-bob-white?</i> A very clear, sweet, musical
whistle.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Grassy meadows and cultivated fields; farmyards,
thickets, and swamps during the winter.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern North America, from southern Canada to the
Gulf Coast and northern Florida and west to eastern
Colorado. Usually a resident.</p>
<p class="bq">In Florida, except in the north, is found the <span class="small">FLORIDA

in appearance from the eastern quail. It has a
nodding plume on its head and is largely black,
white, and brownish-gray.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>No birds of my acquaintance, unless it be bluebirds,
goldfinches, chickadees, and thrushes, seem so lovable,
so interesting, and so altogether desirable as quail.
Our summer meadows would lose much of their charm
without the cheery &ldquo;Bob White&rdquo; ringing across them.</p>
<p>The character of human beings is shown in their voices;
that of birds seems likewise revealed. The note of the
quail breathes sweetness, tenderness, joy in life, and deep
contentment. Unless need of food compels it, the killing
of these nearly human creatures seems to me like the
&ldquo;Slaughter of the Innocents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Few birds are so devoted to their mates or to their young
as the quail. Many human parents are less alive to parental
responsibilities. It is a well-known fact that while
Mother Quail is sitting upon her second nestful of a dozen
or more eggs, Father Bob assumes the entire care of the
large, restless, older brood.</p>
<p>Most birds love their mates and their young, but quail
seem to have affection for their brothers and sisters, also.
The parents and the two broods sometimes remain together
during the winter. When one member of the family is
lost, the others give their tender covey-call, to lure home
the prodigal. There are few sweeter sounds in nature.
Mr. Forbush says: &ldquo;When the broods are scattered by
the gunner, they are reassembled again by a whistled call
of the old bird, which has been given, &lsquo;<i>ka-loi-kee, ka-loi-kee</i>,&rsquo;
and is answered by the whistled repeated response,
&lsquo;<i>whoil-kee</i>.&rsquo; The syllables almost run together. The
first call is uttered with a rising and the other with a falling
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
inflection. It is plainly the rallying call and the answering
cry.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a></p>
<p>Dallas Lore Sharp, in his charming book &ldquo;Wild Life
Near Home,&rdquo; refers to the covey-call as follows: &ldquo;It
was the sweetest bird-note I ever heard, being so low, so
liquid, so mellow that I almost doubted if Bob White
could make it. But there she stood in the snow with head
high, listening anxiously. Again she whistled, louder
this time; and from the woods below came a faint answering
call, <i>White!</i> The answer seemed to break a spell; and
on three sides of me sounded other calls. At this the little
signaler repeated her efforts, and each time the answers
came louder and nearer. Presently something dark hurried
by me over the snow and joined the quail I was watching.
It was one of the covey I had heard call from the
woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again and again the signal was sent forth, until a
third, fourth, and finally a fifth were grouped about the
leader. There was just an audible twitter of welcome and
gratitude exchanged as each new-comer made his appearance.
Once more the whistle sounded; but this time there
was no response across the silent field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young quail are very precocious. They are able to
run about soon after they are hatched. They early learn
how to hide and &ldquo;freeze.&rdquo; A friend told me of coming
suddenly upon a brood. The mother gave a call and all
fled instantly, except one that turned into a little brown
wooden image under a leaf at his feet. He picked it up
and held it in his hand. Not a motion did it make until
its mother gave a second call, when it shot out of his hand
like a flash.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Another friend told me of her experience in finding a
lost baby-quail. It was too little and too weak to keep
up with the family&mdash;was probably the last born. It was
so tired and distressed that when she knelt down and
placed her cupped hand near it, the poor little thing ran
to it, nestled down, and shut its eyes. She discovered the
brood and carried the baby over to join its family, but it
seemed loath to leave her. Three times it ran back to
the warm shelter of her hand. She could hardly bear to
abandon it to the life that seemed more than it could endure.</p>
<p>Dr. Judd made a careful study of the bobwhite. The
following extracts are from his report: &ldquo;It is the general
opinion that with the on-coming of winter the bobwhite is
found less often in the open fields, when withered herbaceous
plants afford but scant protection from enemies,
than in dense bushy, briery coverts and woods. In Maryland
and Virginia, the scattered and depleted coveys after
the shooting season evidently unite into large bevies.
Their favorite resort is a bank with a southern exposure
and suitable food-supply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robert Ridgway found a clutch of freshly deposited
eggs in southern Illinois on October 16, and H. C. Munger
found another set in Missouri in January, the parent being
afterwards found frozen on the nest. Authentic records
show that bobwhite has been known to breed, at least
occasionally, somewhere in its range every month in the
year....</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Maryland and Virginia large land-owners often
feed their birds in severe weather. Wheat and corn are
the best food and should be scattered, if possible, among
the briers where the birds are safe from hawks. Bobwhites
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
have been known to feed with chickens in barnyards.
By a little forethought land-owners and sportsmen
can easily make provision for their birds. Sumac bushes
should be left along hedgerows and the edge of woodland
to furnish food that is always above the snow and lasts
well into spring.... The bayberry and wax-myrtle last
until May, also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The food habits of the bobwhite are noteworthy in several
respects. Vegetable matter has long been known to
be an important element in the food of the bobwhite.
Grain-eating birds are likely to do much harm to
crops.... The bobwhite is a notable exception. Not a
single sprouting kernel was found in the crops and stomachs
of quail examined.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a></p>
<p>Dr. Judd enumerates eighty-eight varieties of weed
seeds that are eaten by quail, and states an amazing number
eaten at one time. &ldquo;One bird shot at Marshall Hall
had eaten 1000 ragweed akenes; another contained [quantities
of] leguminous seeds, mainly tick-trefoil; a third
had eaten 5000 seeds of green foxtail grass, while a fourth
had taken about 10000 [infinitesimal] pigweed seeds.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fn_24">[24]</a></p>
<p>As an insect-destroyer the bobwhite is of enormous
value. During the summer, insects form more then one-third
of its food. Over one hundred varieties had been
discovered by examination of the stomachs of quail in
1905, an unusually large proportion of which were highly
injurious to crops. Mr. Forbush thinks that no farmer
in Massachusetts can afford to shoot a quail or allow it to
be shot on his land, and that if the markets must be supplied,
quail must be reared artificially.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Our bobwhite sleeps on the ground. The California
quail roosts in bushes or trees. One summer evening in
Santa Barbara it was my privilege to see a charming phase
of quail family life. I was sitting quietly under a tree on
a knoll that overlooked a flat shed-roof, when I heard a
low call, and a whirring of wings. Mother Quail, accompanied
by thirteen little balls of brown feathers, alighted
on the roof near me. She talked to her adorable family,
and, judging by their quick responses, she evidently gave
them numerous commands. They finally ran to the edge
of the roof and arranged themselves in a row, faces outward,
until she gave another call. Then obediently they
gathered around her in a true Kindergarten Circle, heads
outward and tails toward her, all ready for bed. There
they nestled, until a passer-by disturbed them and, to my
great regret, they flew away. In a few minutes I heard
a clear loud <i>ku-ku-kow</i>, and on the same roof alighted
Father Bob with fifteen restless boys and girls&mdash;a veritable
Primary Class. He had more trouble in controlling
them than Mother had experienced with her docile little
ones; they ran hither and thither in spite of his insistent,
anxious calls. He succeeded in gathering them about
him, however; but just as they were forming their circle,
they, too, were frightened away.</p>

<h2>THE RUFFED GROUSE
<br /><i>Grouse Family&mdash;Tetraonid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 17 inches.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Upper parts reddish-brown, with black, yellowish, gray,
and whitish markings; large tufts or &ldquo;ruffs&rdquo; of glossy
black feathers at the sides of the neck. Tail long
and broad, gray and reddish-brown, mottled and
barred with black, and a broad blackish band near
the end; when spread, the tail resembles a fan.
Under parts buffy, becoming white, with black bars
that are indistinct on breast and belly, and darker
on the sides; a broken band on the breast.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Similar to male, but with smaller ruffs on the sides
of the neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<b>Love-song</b>&rdquo;: A loud tattoo or drumming that sounds like a
thump on a large drum&mdash;a <i>tum-tum-tum-tum-tum-tup-tup-whir-r-r-r-r-r</i>.
This tattoo is most common in
late winter and early spring, but may be heard in
the summer and fall. While heard most frequently
during the day, it may be heard at any hour of the
night. In making it, the bird usually stands very
erect on a hollow log or stump, with head held high
and ruffs erected and spread, and, raising its wings,
strikes downward and forward. The sound produced
is a muffled boom or thump. It begins with a few
slow beats, gradually growing quicker, and ends in
a rolling, accelerated &ldquo;tattoo.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a></p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: A bird of the woods that nests on the ground.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: A resident in the northern two-thirds of the United
States and in the forested parts of Canada.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>The Ruffed Grouse, the finest and most famous
game-bird of the northern woods, was formerly
very abundant. Its numbers have greatly decreased.
Like the bobwhite, it responds to protection and may be
raised under artificial conditions. It eats nearly sixty
kinds of wild fruit; beechnuts, hazelnuts, chestnuts, acorns,
and weed seeds form a large part of its diet. It eats
some insects, the most important being beetles of various
kinds.</p>
<p>Mr. Forbush says: &ldquo;The female alone undertakes the
task of incubation and the care of the young.... All the
young grouse in a nest hatch at nearly the same instant;
their feathers dry very rapidly, and they are soon ready to
run about.... They run about, stealing noiselessly along
among the dead leaves, under the foliage of ferns and
shrubbery.... Meanwhile, the mother marches slowly
in the rear, perhaps to guard them against surprise from
any keen-scented animal that may follow on the trail.
She seems to be always on the alert, and a single warning
note from her will cause the young birds to flatten themselves
on the ground or to hide under leaves, where they
will remain motionless until they are trodden upon, rather
than run the risk of betraying themselves by attempting to
escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the fall, the Grouse keep together in small
flocks. Sometimes a dozen birds may be found around
some favorite grape vine or apple tree, but they are usually
so harried and scattered by gunners that toward winter the
old birds may sometimes be found alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As winter approaches, this hardy bird puts on its
&lsquo;snowshoes,&rsquo; which consist of a fringe of horny processes
or pectinations that grow out along each toe, and help to
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
distribute the weight of the bird over a larger surface, and
so allow it to walk over snows into which a bird not so
provided would sink deeply. Its digestion must resemble
that of the famous Ostrich, as broken twigs and dry leaves
are ground up in its mill. It is a hard winter that will
starve the Grouse. A pair spent many winter nights in
a little cave in the rocky wall of an old quarry. Sumacs
grew there, and many rank weeds. The birds lived well
on sumac berries, weed seeds, and buds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes, but perhaps rarely, these birds are imprisoned
under the snow by the icy crust which forms in cold
weather following a rain, but usually they are vigorous
enough to find a way out somewhere. The Grouse is perfectly
at home beneath the snow; it will dive into it to
escape a Hawk, and can move rapidly about beneath the
surface and burst out again in rapid flight at some unexpected
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ruffed Grouse is a bird of the woodland, and
though useful in the woods, it sometimes does some injury
in the orchard by removing too many buds from a single
tree. In winter and early spring, when other food is buried
by the snow and hard to obtain, the Grouse lives
largely on the buds and green twigs of trees; but as spring
advances, insects form a considerable part of the food.
The young feed very largely on insects, including many
very destructive species.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a></p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<h2>THE CEDAR WAXWING OR CEDAR-BIRD
<br /><i>Called Locally the &ldquo;Cherry Bird&rdquo;
<br />Waxwing Family or Bombycillid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: A little over 7 inches.</p>
<p><b>General Appearance</b>: A grayish-brown bird, with a decided
crest and a yellow band at end of tail. Plump and
well-fed in appearance.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: A beautiful, rich grayish-brown with a soft
yellow breast. Head conspicuously crested; forehead
glossy black; a black line above the bill is extended
toward the top of the head, outlining the
crest; crest elevated and lowered to express surprise,
contentment, fear and other emotions; bill and chin
black; throat blackish. Wings brown, becoming a
soft gray; wing-feathers with small red tips that look
like bits of sealing-wax&mdash;hence the name, Waxwing.
Tail light gray, shading to a dark grey, rounded, fan-shaped
in flight, and edged with a broad yellow
band.</p>
<p><b>Young</b>: Grayish-brown, streaked, and without red tips to their
wings.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: A gentle lisping <i>tseep, tseep</i>, monotonous and uninteresting.
Mr. Forbush says of the waxwing, &ldquo;It moves
about in silence, save as it utters a lisping &lsquo;beading&rsquo;
note or a &lsquo;hushed whistle.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: During the nesting season, devoted pairs may be seen
in orchards, in red cedars, or in shrubbery by roadsides,
preferably near trees or bushes laden with
berries. The birds are rovers, usually flying in
large flocks.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: North America. Breeds from south-central Canada to
southern Oregon, northern New Mexico, Kansas,
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
northern Arkansas, and North Carolina; winters irregularly
throughout nearly all the United States,
and south to Cuba, Mexico, and Panama.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cedar Waxwings are among our most exquisite
birds in their delicate blending of color and in
their dainty refinement. They seem to have been tinted
by a water-color artist, or an expert in the use of pastels.
Their proverbial good manners seem to preclude any disturbance
of their well-preened feathers by undue haste of
movement or quarrelsome ruffling.</p>
<p>My earliest recollections of these beautiful but rather
uninteresting birds is of their frequent raids upon a great
mulberry tree in my grandparents&rsquo; garden. They gorged
upon the dead-ripe mulberries with the quiet enjoyment of
epicures rather than the greedy haste of gourmands. I
remember, also, my grandmother&rsquo;s dismay at the inroads
which the &ldquo;cherry-birds&rdquo; and robins made upon her cherry
crop, and my bird-loving grandfather&rsquo;s command that no
bird should be molested.</p>
<p>Cedar, juniper, sumac, and mountain ash berries, form
the winter diet of these frugivorous birds. As a larder
is speedily exhausted by a flock of from twenty to sixty
hungry fruit-eaters, they must fly to &ldquo;pastures new.&rdquo;
During the spring and summer seasons, they supplement
their diet of wild fruit, most of which is of no commercial
value, with beetles that infest potato-patches and elm
trees, and cankerworms that prey upon apple trees. They
are very valuable to man, and earn their dessert of cultivated
cherries. Mr. Forbush says that they deserve the
name of &ldquo;cankerworm birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He writes as follows: &ldquo;They frequent infested orchards
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
in large flocks, and fill themselves with the worms
until they can eat no more. Such little gluttons rarely
can be found among birds. The Cedar-bird seems to
have the most rapid digestion of any bird with which experiments
have been made. Audubon said that Cedar-birds
would gorge themselves with fruit until they could
be taken by hand; and that he had seen wounded birds,
confined in a cage, eat of apples until suffocated. They
will stuff themselves to the very throat. So, wherever
they feed, their appetites produce a visible effect. Professor
Forbes estimates that thirty Cedar-birds will destroy
ninety thousand cankerworms in a month. This calculation
seems to be far within bounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cedar-birds are devoted to each other and to their
young. Sometimes a row of six or eight may be seen,
sitting close together on a limb, passing and repassing
from beak to beak a fat caterpillar or juicy cherry. I
have seen this touching courtesy but once, and believe it
was done not so much from politeness as from the fact
that most of the birds were so full that they had no room
for more&mdash;a condition in which they could afford to be
generous. Nevertheless, the manner in which it was done,
and the simulation of tender regard and consideration
for each other exhibited, rendered it a sight well worth
seeing. They also have a habit of &lsquo;billing&rsquo; or saluting
one another with the bill.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a></p>
<p>A flock of cedar-birds &ldquo;seep&rdquo; and whisper to each other
like over-fed children. Their note seems to be an expression
of their gentle, affectionate, comfortable, ease-loving
natures. There appears to be absence of aspiration or
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
longing in their bird-hearts, which seems so poignant in
thrushes and many other songsters.</p>
<h3>THE BOHEMIAN WAXWING</h3>
<p>The Bohemian Waxwing is very similar to its cousin,
the Cedar Waxwing, in color and markings, but may be
distinguished by its <i>larger size</i>, (8 inches), by <i>reddish-brown
feathers under the tail, by the absence of yellow on
the breast, by a crown that is reddish-brown in front</i>, and
<i>by yellow and white markings on the wings</i>. In note,
feeding habits, and other characteristics, it resembles the
Cedar-bird.</p>
<p>This larger species of waxwing is found in the colder
regions of the whole Northern Hemisphere. In North
America it breeds from northern Alaska and northern
Canada to southern British Columbia and Alberta; winters
east to Nova Scotia and south irregularly to eastern
California, Colorado, Kansas, southern Illinois, Indiana,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut. It is a rare winter
visitor in Massachusetts.</p>

<p class="caption">TUFTED TITMOUSE</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<h2>THE TUFTED TITMOUSE OR TOMTIT
<br /><i>Titmouse Family&mdash;Parid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 6 inches; a little smaller than the English
sparrow.</p>
<p><b>General Appearance</b>: A slender, active, gray and white bird,
<i>with a crest</i>. Its reddish-brown sides are not visible
at a distance. The titmouse need never be confused
with the waxwing; it is much smaller, and lacks the
yellow and red markings on tail and wings.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: Head conspicuously crested; crest gray
and pointed; forehead black; bill short, sharp,
black; back, wings, and tail gray; under parts
whitish, with a reddish-brown wash on the sides.</p>
<p><b>Call-note</b>: <i>De-de-de-de</i>, similar to one of the chickadee&rsquo;s notes,
but louder.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A loud, sweet, clear whistle: <i>Pe&rsquo;-to, pe&rsquo;-to, pe&rsquo;-to, pe&rsquo;-to,
pe&rsquo;-to</i>, frequently repeated five times. The titmouse
is called locally the &ldquo;Peter-bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Woodlands; open groves of hard-wood trees preferred.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Rare in New England. From Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois,
Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, south
to central Texas, the Gulf Coast, and Florida; occasional
in Wisconsin, Michigan, New York, and Connecticut.
Common permanent resident near Washington,
especially in winter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No winter bird more truly exemplifies protective coloring
than the lively crested Tomtit, unless it be
his little cousin, the Black-capped Chickadee. This sober-hued
titmouse is such a blending of the grays and
blacks of tree-trunk and icy brook, of the dazzling white of
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
snow and the soft gray shadows that lie across it, of reddish-brown
shrubs and weeds, that he might escape notice
except for his conspicuous crest. He can be distinguished
from the cedar waxwing at a glance by his reddish sides,
and because of the <i>absence</i> of a yellow band across the tail
and of conspicuous black, white, and red patches or markings.</p>
<p>Few more active birds exist than titmice. They are at
once the envy and the despair of aspiring small boys who
know them, because of their extreme agility&mdash;their ability
to perform acrobatic feats. They swing head downward
from twigs in the search for their favorite food of insect-eggs;
they seem strung on wires.</p>
<p>In the woodlands frequented by tufted titmice, they are
as much in evidence as blue jays, because of their loud,
clear <i>peto-peto-peto-peto-peto</i>, a welcome and pleasant
sound during belated spring days or a bleak March &ldquo;sugaring-off&rdquo;
season.</p>
<p>They are less friendly than chickadees, but are not shy,
so they can be observed easily. They are very sociable
with their kind, and are found, &ldquo;playing around&rdquo; with
chickadees, nuthatches, and downy woodpeckers in the
winter-time, and snuggling close together in old nest-holes
during winter weather. In the spring, titmice use hollowed
trees for their nesting sites and have been known to
welcome a nesting-box.</p>
<p>These birds do enormous good, not only in eating insect-eggs,
but in destroying caterpillars, cutworms, beetles,
weevils, flies, wasps, plant-lice, and scale-insects in their
season.<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a> They will eat berries, nuts, and acorns during
the winter and are extremely hardy.</p>

a soft brownish-gray; wings and tail gray, edged

<p><b>Song</b>: <i>Chick-a-dee-dee-dee</i>, uttered with gurgles and chuckles,
and with variations.</p>
<p><b>Call-notes</b>: <i>Day&rsquo;-day</i>, and a whistle that resembles the word
<i>P&eacute;-whee</i>. The latter note is often called the &ldquo;Ph&oelig;be
note,&rdquo; and sometimes the &ldquo;Pewee note.&rdquo; To me it
resembles neither; it is not hoarse and wheezing like
the ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s, nor plaintive like the pewee&rsquo;s. The
last syllable has a descending inflection.</p>
<p><b>Flight</b>: Very swift and jerky.</p>

<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern North America, from the Hudson Bay region

<p class="bq">The <span class="small">CAROLINA CHICKADEE</span>, a smaller species, breeds
from central Missouri, Indiana, central Ohio, Pennsylvania

the <span class="small">FLORIDA CHICKADEES</span>, that are still smaller and

</blockquote>
<p>During tiresome days of a winter convalescence,
spent largely on a sleeping-porch that overlooked a
beautiful hillside, my most constant and cheering companions
were lively little chickadees. Their blending with the
winter landscape was perfect. Whether they were seen
against the black snow-laden trunks or smooth gray boles
of beeches, or among yellowish willow-withes, they were
bits of color harmony.</p>
<p>These active little gymnasts, performing unexpected
feats in their swinging from horizontal bars, furnished
pleasant diversion, while their friendly, confiding ways,
their undaunted fearlessness, and their optimism cheered
lonely hours.</p>
<p>An ice-storm necessitated the spreading of a table for
our brave little all-kinds-of-weather friends. They came
in pairs, grew very tame, and drew near to us like confiding
children who knew that no harm would befall them.
They acted as though our care of them was the most natural
thing in the world. Chickadees have never seemed to
me to &ldquo;grow up,&rdquo; but always to remain the trusting little
ones of the bird-world, too small to be out alone, and yet,
like children, to fare forth with confidence that their needs
would be supplied.</p>
<p>They repay a thousand-fold any care bestowed upon
them. Dr. Judd reported finding in the stomach of one
black-capped chickadee between 200 and 300 eggs of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
fall cankerworm moth, and 450 eggs of a plant louse in
another. Mr. C. E. Bailey computed that one chickadee
alone would destroy 138,750 eggs of the cankerworm
moth in 25 days, while Prof. Sanderson estimated that
8,000,000,000 insects are destroyed yearly in Michigan
by these invaluable little birds.<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Much of the daylight life of the chickadee is spent in a
busy, active pursuit of, or search for, insects and their
eggs. This is particularly the case in winter, when hibernating
insects or their eggs must be most diligently sought,
for then starvation always threatens. But the chickadee
is one of the few insectivorous birds that is keen-witted
enough to find abundant food and safe shelter during the
inclement northern winter. Nevertheless, its busy search
for food is sometimes interrupted for so long a time during
severe storms, when the trees are encased in ice, that it dies
from cold and hunger. During a sleet storm Mr. C. E.
Bailey saw two chickadees creep under the loose clapboards
of an old building for shelter. Their tails were so
weighted down with ice that they could hardly fly, and had
he not cared for them they might have perished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chickadee, notwithstanding its hardiness, requires
protection from cold winds and storms at night. It finds
such shelter either in some hollow tree or in some deserted
bird nest. Late one cold and snowy afternoon Mr. Bailey
detected a movement in a cavity under an old crow&rsquo;s nest,
and on climbing the tree he found two chickadees nestling
there. They remained there until he had climbed to the
nest and put his hand on one, when they flew out, only to
return before he reached the ground. Minot speaks of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
chickadee that slept alone in winter in a phoebe&rsquo;s nest under
his veranda. It retires to its refuge rather early at
night, and does not come out until the Tree Sparrow, Song
Sparrow, and Junco are abroad.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a></p>

<p>Though the Golden-crowned Kinglet is one of our
smallest birds, it braves the rigors of winter in the
United States. It may be seen from the latter part

of September until April or early May, when it goes to
its more northerly nesting ground.</p>
<p>Kinglets and chickadees are industrious searchers for
insects&rsquo; eggs. Their value is almost inestimable. Mr.
Forbush tells of watching the &ldquo;Gold-crest&rdquo; hunt for its food
among the pines. He says: &ldquo;The birds were fluttering
about among the trees. Each one would hover for a moment
before a tuft of pine &lsquo;needles,&rsquo; and then either alight
upon it and feed or pass on to another. I examined the
&lsquo;needles&rsquo; after the Kinglets had left them, and could find
nothing on them; but when a bird was disturbed before it
had finished feeding, the spray from which it had been
driven was invariably found to be infested with numerous
black specks, the eggs of plant lice. Evidently the birds
were cleaning each spray thoroughly, as far as they
went.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Forbush tells also of observing the work of seven
kinglets in a grove of white pine which &ldquo;must have been
infested with countless thousands of these eggs, for the
band of Kinglets remained there until March 25, almost
three months later, apparently feeding most of the time on
these eggs. When they had cleared the branches, the little
birds fluttered about the trunks, hanging poised on busy
wing, like Hummingbirds before a flower, meanwhile rapidly
pecking the clinging eggs from the bark. In those
three months they must have suppressed hosts of little tree
pests, for I have never seen birds more industrious and assiduous
in their attentions to the trees. One might expect
such work of Creepers or of Woodpeckers; but the Kinglets
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
seemed to have departed from their usual habits of gleaning
among limbs and foliage, to take the place of the missing
Creepers, not one of which was seen in the grove last
winter.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a></p>

<h2>THE CAROLINA WREN
<br /><i>Wren Family&mdash;Troglodytid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 5&frac12; inches; the largest of the six more common
eastern wrens.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: Reddish-brown above; <i>no bars</i> or <i>streaks</i>,
except on wings and tail, and occasionally underneath
the body, near the tail; a <i>long light line over
the eye, extending to the shoulders</i>; under parts buff
with a brownish wash; throat white.</p>
<p><b>Notes</b>: &ldquo;Wren-like <i>chucks</i> of annoyance or interrogation,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;a peculiar fluttering <i>k-r-r-r-r-uck</i>, which resembles
the bleating call of a tree-toad.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a></p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A loud clear whistle, consisting of three similar syllables,
with variations.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Thickets, vines, and undergrowth.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern United States. Breeds from southeastern Nebraska,
Iowa, Ohio, southern Pennsylvania, the lower
Hudson and Connecticut valleys south to central
Texas, Gulf States, and northern Florida; casual
north to Wisconsin, Michigan, Ontario, Massachusetts,
New Hampshire, and Maine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Professor Beal writes of this interesting wren as
follows: &ldquo;The Carolina wren is resident from the
Gulf of Mexico north to the southern boundaries of Iowa,
Illinois, and Connecticut in the breeding season, but in
winter it withdraws somewhat farther south. It is a bird
of the thicket and undergrowth, preferring to place its
nest in holes and crannies, but when necessary, will build
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
a bulky structure in a tangle of twigs and vines. Unlike
the house wren it does not ordinarily use the structures of
man for nesting sites.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is one of the few American birds that sing throughout
the year. Most birds sing, or try to, in the mating
season, but the Carolina wren may be heard pouring forth
his melody of song every month. The writer&rsquo;s first introduction
to this bird was in the month of January when
he heard gushing from a thicket a song which reminded
him of June instead of midwinter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This wren keeps up the reputation of the family as
an insect-eater, as over nine-tenths of its diet consists
of insects and their allies.&rdquo; Stomach analysis shows that
the vegetable food of the Carolina wren is largely seeds of
trees and shrubs and some wild berries. He concludes:
&ldquo;From this analysis of the food of the Carolina wren, it is
evident that the farmer and fruit-grower have not the slightest
cause for complaint against the bird. It eats neither
cultivated fruit nor grain, and does not even nest in an orchard
tree; but it does feed on numerous injurious insects
and enlivens the tangled thickets with its cheerful songs
for twelve months of the year.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a></p>
<p>Dr. Witmer Stone writes of the song of the Carolina wren
as follows: &ldquo;His most characteristic song has been likened
by Mr. Chapman to <i>tea-kettle, tea-kettle, tea-kettle</i>,
and to <i>whee-udle, whee-udle, whee-udle</i>. Wilson wrote it
<i>sweet-william, sweet-william, sweet-william</i>; and to Audubon
it seemed to say <i>come-to-me, come-to-me, come-to-me</i>.
It has variations recalling forms in the Cardinal&rsquo;s song,
and also that of the Tufted Titmouse; and the Wren after
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
repeating one form for some time, often changes suddenly
to another producing a rather startling effect, as if another
bird has taken its place.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a></p>

<h2>THE WINTER WREN
<br /><i>Wren Family&mdash;Troglodytid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 4 inches; the same size as the golden-crowned
kinglet.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: Similar in appearance to the house wren,
but smaller and with a shorter tail; body brown,
mostly barred with fine, black lines; light line over
the eye; under parts darker than those of the house
wren, with a buff wash across throat and breast.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A very beautiful song, unusually loud for so small a
bird. Those fortunate enough to hear it are extravagant
in their praise. Mr. Eaton calls it the sweetest
melody that he and his associates heard in the
Adirondacks, excelling even the thrushes.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Brush heaps, thickets in woods, along streams, and
in wild rocky places.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Breeds from southern Canada to Minnesota, Wisconsin,
Michigan, New York, and Massachusetts, through
the Alleghanies to North Carolina; winters from
about its southern breeding limit to Texas and northern
Florida.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eaton says: &ldquo;During the migration, this little
wren is commonly observed about the shrubbery of
our lawns, parks, and the edges of woods, when disturbed
retreating to the recesses of some brush pile or under the
damp edges of the stream bank. A few remain throughout
the winter in western and central New York, and it is
fairly common as a winter resident in the southeastern
portion of the State, but in the principal breeding range
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
of the Adirondacks and Catskills it is only a summer resident.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a>
It is a rather common winter visitor near Washington,
and rare in New England.</p>

<h2>THE DOWNY WOODPECKER
<br /><i>Woodpecker Family&mdash;Picid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: A little over 6&frac12; inches; the smallest of our woodpeckers.</p>
<p><b>General Appearance</b>: A <i>small</i> black and white bird, with a
<i>white stripe extending down the middle of its back</i>;
a red patch on back of male&rsquo;s head. The tail is used
for a prop as the woodpecker climbs tree-trunks.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Upper parts black and white; crown of head black with
<i>red patch at nape</i>; two broad white stripes above and
below eye; a <i>broad white stripe down the center of
back</i>; wings spotted and barred with white; tail
sharply pointed; the long tail-feathers, black; the
short <i>outer tail-feathers, white barred with black</i>;
bill long, strong, with a tuft of feathers at its base.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Like male, except for the <i>absence of a red patch on
the head</i>.</p>
<p><b>Notes</b>: A call-note <i>Peek-peek</i>. A metallic <i>Tut-tut-tut&rsquo;-tut-tut-tut-tut</i>
might be considered the Downy&rsquo;s song, but he
belongs really to the group of songless birds. He
beats loud tattoos on the boughs of trees, especially
at mating time.</p>
<p><b>Flight</b>: Labored, jerky, with a characteristic shutting of the
wings against the sides.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Tree-trunks in woods and orchards, and on lawns.
The Downy is our most common woodpecker, and a
permanent resident.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Northern and central parts of eastern North America,
from Alberta, Manitoba, and Ungava, south to eastern
Nebraska, Kansas, the Potomac Valley, and in
the mountains to North Carolina.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p class="bq">The <span class="small">SOUTHERN DOWNY WOODPECKER</span> of the South
Atlantic and Gulf States is smaller and browner than
its northern relative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Downy Woodpecker is a member of a family of
birds that has attracted man&rsquo;s attention since the old
days of superstition. Various myths have grown up
around these birds; those of the American Indians are
possibly the most interesting. Until recently, woodpeckers
have been persecuted by the white man, because of
their habit of pecking at trees which they were thought to
kill. Many have been unjustly slain.</p>
<p>While one branch of the family, the Sapsuckers, have
done a great deal of harm to forests where they breed, and
other woodpeckers have done occasional damage, it is now
known that they are invaluable as preservers of our trees.
Entomologists and foresters consider them the greatest
enemies known of spruce-bark beetles and sap-wood borers.
As borers are found near the surface in living trees,
the holes made by woodpeckers while extracting them soon
heals and leaves little mark.</p>
<p>An examination of the structure of woodpeckers shows
the admirable way in which they are fitted for their work.
They have short, stout legs; strong feet, usually with two
toes in front and two in the back; large claws, and stiff
tails tipped with sharp spines, to aid them in supporting
themselves firmly against tree-trunks and branches. Mr.
Forbush says: &ldquo;The bird is thus more fully equipped
for climbing than a telegraph lineman. The claws and
tail take the place of the man&rsquo;s hand and spurs.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a></p>
<p>Professor Beal writes the following: &ldquo;As much of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
food of woodpeckers is obtained from solid wood, Nature
has provided most of them with a stout beak having a
chisel-shaped point which forms an exceedingly effective
instrument. But the most peculiar and interesting point
in the anatomy of these birds is the tongue. This is more
or less cylindrical in form and usually very long. At
the anterior end it generally terminates in a hard point,
with more or less barbs upon the sides. Posteriorly the
typical woodpecker tongue is extended in two long,
slender filaments of the hyoid bone <i>which curl up around
the back of the skull</i> and, while they commonly stop between
the eyes, in some species they pass around the eye,
but in others enter the right nasal opening and extend to
the end of the beak. In this last case the tongue is practically
twice the length of the head. Posteriorly this organ
is inclosed in a muscular sheath by means of which it can
be extruded from the mouth to a considerable length, and
used as a most effective instrument for dislodging grubs or
ants from their burrows in wood or bark. Hence, while
most birds have to be content with such insects as they
find on the surface or in open crevices, the woodpeckers
devote their energies to those larv&aelig; or grubs which are
beneath the bark or even in the heart of the tree. They
locate their hidden prey with great accuracy, and often cut
small holes directly to the burrows of the grubs.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Forbush calls attention to the wonderfully constructed
head of a woodpecker &ldquo;which is built so that it
can withstand hard and continuous hammering. The skull
is very thick and hard. Its connection with the beak is
strong, but at the same time springy, and somewhat jar-deadening.
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
The membrane which surrounds the brain
is very thick and strong.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a></p>
<p>The Downy is the smallest member of the woodpecker
family in North America, and is one of the most useful.
He is especially fond of orchards and shade trees,
and not only devours insects that infest them during the
spring and summer, but eats the eggs they laid in the
crevices of the bark during the winter. One Downy alone
is of inestimable value in an orchard or a grove. Mr.
Forbush writes as follows: &ldquo;When the Metropolitan
Park Commission first began to set out young trees along
the parkways of Boston, some species of trees were attacked
by borers; but the Downy Woodpeckers found them
out and extracted the grubs, saving most of the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The untiring industry of this bird and the perfection
of its perceptive powers may be shown by the experience
of Mr. Bailey. On March 28, 1899, a Downy Woodpecker
that he watched climbed over and inspected one hundred
and eighty-one woodland trees between 9:40 <span class="small">A. M.</span> and
12:15 <span class="small">P. M.</span>, and made twenty-six excavations for food.
Most of these holes exposed galleries in the trunks in high
branches where wood-boring ants were hiding.... These
ants often gain an entrance at some unprotected spot on a
living tree, and so excavate the wood of the trunk that the
tree is blown down by the wind. This woodpecker acts as
a continual check on the increase of such ants.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fn_39">[39]</a></p>
<p>The Downy may easily be attracted to our yards by a
piece of suet fastened securely to a tree. During the past
winter, one has sought my suet-cage, in company with
chickadees and nuthatches. This spring he brought his
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
mate to a maple in front of the house. He has seemed
excited and happy, and has drummed persistently on a
certain broken limb of the tree. He has indulged in numerous
rapid flights and his metallic, ringing call.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<h2>THE HAIRY WOODPECKER
<br /><i>Woodpecker Family&mdash;Picid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 9&frac12; inches; nearly &#8531; larger than the Downy,
whom he <i>resembles almost identically as to general
appearance, except in</i> <span class="small">SIZE</span>.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Black and white above; white underneath; <i>broad white
stripe down</i> the <i>middle of</i> the <i>back</i>; head with black
and white stripes, a red patch at the back, and bristles
at the bill; wings black, with white stripes and
bars; tail black, with white outside feathers; <i>the absence
of black flecks on the tail-feathers and the
larger size of the bird</i> distinguishes the Hairy from
the Downy.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Like male, except for the absence of a red patch on
the head.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: A loud, shrill call, difficult to imitate or to reproduce
on paper for identification. The Hairy also &ldquo;drums&rdquo;
on the boughs of trees; it has no real song.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Tree-trunks in woodlands, rather than in orchards or
gardens, though I have noticed these woodpeckers in
winter frequenting the trees of village streets without
shyness or fear. During the breeding season,
they remain in secluded spots in the woods.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Three species of the Hairy Woodpecker may be found
in Canada and the United States; the <span class="small">NORTHERN
HAIRY WOODPECKER</span>, the <span class="small">HAIRY WOODPECKER</span>, and the
<span class="small">SOUTHERN HAIRY WOODPECKER</span>. The northern species
lives in the tree-zone of Canada, and is the largest of
the three; the Hairy, next in size, may be found in
the United States from Colorado, Nebraska, and
Oklahoma, to the middle and northern parts of the
Eastern States. The Southern Hairy, the smallest of
the three, is a resident of our southern section.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>The Hairy Woodpecker is so like his small Downy
relative in appearance and habits that his characteristics
are not usually dwelt upon; he is like an older neglected
cousin of a baby upon whom much attention is
lavished.</p>
<p>But he is very worth while attracting. He is as untiring
as the Downy in his quest for beetles, his favorite kind of
tree-food; he is also a lover of ants and other &ldquo;borers.&rdquo;
His longer bill enables him to reach many that the Downy
cannot. One Hairy Woodpecker alone saved an entire
orchard that had become infested with &ldquo;borers.&rdquo; One
tree had died before he began his rescue-work, but he
saved all the others.<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a></p>
<p>He likes the caterpillars of the cecropia and gypsy
moths. He eats much vegetable food, especially during
the winter; he has been known to take an occasional bite
of the soft inner bark of trees and a drink of sap which he
has well earned. Like the Downy, he will eat suet in the
winter season.</p>
<p>Mr. Forbush writes: &ldquo;While this bird often excavates
a hole for winter shelter, it sometimes sleeps exposed on
a tree-trunk. Mr. Bailey and I once watched one that
slept for many winter nights on the north side of a tree
trunk in a thick grove. It attached its claws to the bark
and went to sleep in much the same position in which it
ordinarily climbed the tree. It invariably went to the
same tree at night, and was found in the same place at
daylight every morning.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fn_40">[40]</a></p>

<h2>THE WHITE-BREASTED NUTHATCH
<br /><i>Nuthatch Family&mdash;Sittid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 6 inches.</p>
<p><b>General Appearance</b>: A short, thickset bird, blue-gray, black,
and white. Bill long; tail short and square.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Mostly bluish-gray above; white underneath, shading to
reddish-brown at sides and under tail; top of head
and nape a shining blue-black; sides of head
and throat white; wings gray shading to brown,
edged and tipped with light gray or white; shoulders
gray and black; bill large and strong, (&frac34; of an
inch in length); tail short and square-cut; middle
feathers bluish-gray; outer ones black, with large
white patches near tips; legs short; feet large and
strong; hind toe unusually long, with a long, sharp
nail.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Head a dull grayish-black; otherwise like male.</p>
<p><b>Notes</b>: A nasal <i>crank-crank</i>, which, though not melodious, is
not unpleasant to hear. Dr. Chapman says: &ldquo;There
is such a lack of sentiment in the Nuthatch&rsquo;s character,
he seems so matter-of-fact in all his ways, that
it is difficult to imagine him indulging in anything
like song. But even he cannot withstand the conquering
influences of spring, and at that season he
raises his voice in a peculiar monotone&mdash;a tenor
<i>hah-hah-hah-hah-hah</i>&mdash;sounding strangely like mirthless
laughter.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a></p>
<p><b>Flight</b>: Undulating.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Trunks of trees, which he ascends and descends.
The other tree-trunk birds, except the black and
white warbler, usually ascend trees.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">

<p class="caption">NUTHATCH</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p><b>Range</b>: North America, east of the Plains. A permanent resident,
though irregularly distributed. Breeds from
central Canada to the northern parts of the Gulf
States.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the so-called tree-trunk birds, none are easier to
identify than nuthatches, because of their habit
of <i>descending</i> trees. Woodpeckers jerk themselves up a
tree somewhat as men might ascend telegraph-poles or
smooth slippery palm trees. Creepers wind spirally about
trunks in a gentle, unobtrusive manner. Both woodpeckers
and creepers use their sharply-pointed tails as
props. Not so the nuthatches. They care not how they
go&mdash;&ldquo;uphill or down dale&rdquo;&mdash;all is one to them. They are
as sure-footed as burros descending the Grand Canyon.
If they depart from their trail, and decide to leap from
crag to crag of their arboreal cliffs, they alight on their
strong feet with something of the assurance of a cat.
Their tails are not necessary to them as supports.</p>
<p>It is interesting to inquire into the reasons for curious
habits of birds. In the economy of Nature one finds marvelous
adaptations and harmonies. Mr. Francis H.
Allen, in his delightful sketch written for the National Association
of Audubon Societies, speaks of the nuthatch as
&ldquo;filling a gap in nature&rdquo; by approaching his prey from an
angle not possible to woodpeckers and creepers. Mr.
Allen says: &ldquo;He would not have adopted so unusual a
method of feeding if it had not stood him in good stead.
I suspect that by approaching his prey from above he detects
insects and insect-eggs in the crevices of the bark
which would be hidden from another point of view. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
woodpeckers and the creepers can take care of the rest.
Of course these other birds get something of a downward
view as they bend their heads forward, but the Nuthatch
has the advantage of seeing, before he gets to them, some
insects which even a Brown Creeper&rsquo;s gentle approach
would scare into closer hiding in their holes and crannies.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a></p>
<p>In addition to beetles, moths, caterpillars, ants, and
wasps, the nuthatch eats seeds, waste grain, and nuts such
as acorns, beechnuts, and chestnuts.<a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a>
His habit of wedging nuts into some crevice that will hold them securely, and
then using his strong bill as a hatchet to &ldquo;hatch&rdquo; open the
nuts is well-known. From that habit he derives his name,
which Mr. Forbush says originated probably from <i>nuthack</i>
or <i>nuthacker</i>. The bird does much good, and no harm
that is known.</p>
<p>He is active and cheerful, inquisitive, and intelligent.
He makes an interesting winter companion. During an
ice-storm in Asheville, N. C., a nuthatch was attracted by
fragments of bread scattered for the hungry winter birds
during their famine time. This nuthatch pounced on
large crumbs so greedily and purloined them so rapidly
that my sisters feared he would die of acute indigestion!
They finally discovered that he had wedged the crumbs
into large crevices in the bark of a tree near by, and had
stowed one good-sized crust in a hole in a telegraph-pole.
When he had appropriated most of the bread, he spent the
day feasting, going from one store house to another.</p>
<p>A nuthatch in Massachusetts frequently sought an improvised
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
feeding-table made from a bluebird&rsquo;s nesting-box.
One cold morning the owner saw him emerging from
the box, where he had evidently &ldquo;spent the night sitting on
his breakfast,&rdquo; literally seated in the lap of luxury. He
reminded me of that delicious tale I loved to read and contemplate
during childhood,&mdash;of the children who lived in
a candy house and ate their way out of it!</p>
<p>Another New England nuthatch, one that I watched at
my feeding-table, at first made rapid inroads upon the suet-cage,
storing pieces in the cracks of a tree near by. I saw
him tuck one large crumb beneath a warped shingle of the
chicken-house, evidently laying it up for an icy day, instead
of the proverbial rainy one. When an unusually severe
ice-storm occurred, he returned to his store house
and the crumb disappeared. I had the satisfaction of having
assisted him in his dire need.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<h2>THE RED-BREASTED NUTHATCH
<br /><i>Nuthatch Family&mdash;Sittid&aelig;</i></h2>
<p>The Red-breasted Nuthatch is very similar to its
white-breasted cousin except that it is smaller,
(4&frac12; to 5 inches), and is <i>yellowish</i> or &ldquo;<i>rusty</i>&rdquo; <i>underneath</i>,
(except for a white throat), has a <i>white stripe</i> on each side
of its <i>black crown</i>, and a <i>black stripe extending through
the eye</i>. The head of the female is gray, with white and
gray stripes.</p>
<p>This species is not so well known as the white-breasted
nuthatch, because it frequents coniferous forests or woods
that contain evergreens. It breeds from the Upper Yukon
Valley, central Canada, and northern United States, and
winters as far south as lower California, New Mexico,
Arizona, and the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>Mr. Allen says of this bird: &ldquo;To those who know it the
Red-breasted Nuthatch is dear out of all proportion to its
size and its musical attainments. It is livelier than its big
cousin, and prettier in its markings, and there is something
particularly fetching about its quaint little form. It is
even less of a songster than the white-breasted species, for
prolongations and repetitions of its call-note seem to be
all it has that can pass for a song. This call-note can be
rendered as <i>&auml;ap</i>. It is nasal, like that of the White-breasted
Nuthatch, but much higher in pitch, more drawling,
and lacks the <i>r</i>. It has been happily likened to the
sound of a tiny trumpet or tin horn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;The habits of the Red-breasted Nuthatch are so like
those of the White-breasted that much that I have said
about that species is applicable to this. The most striking
difference is in the favorite haunts of the two birds, the
Red-breasted preferring the coniferous woods, or mixed
woods that contain a large proportion of evergreens. In
those winters when they are found in southern New England,
they come freely to the neighborhood of man&rsquo;s dwellings
and feed familiarly on the supplies provided for the
winter birds, but even there they show their partiality for
coniferous trees. They are particularly fond of the seeds
of pines and spruces, so that they are much more vegetarian
than their white-breasted cousins. They have the
same habit of hiding their savings in cracks and crevices.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a></p>

<p><b>Male and Female</b>: Brown above, mottled with gray, buff, and
white; under parts white. A <i>whitish line over eye</i>;
bill long, curved; a bar of buff across wings; tail-feathers
long, <i>sharply pointed</i>; <i>upper tail-coverts
bright reddish-brown</i>.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: A faint, monotonous, <i>skreek-skreek, skreek-skreek</i>.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: According to Brewster, the brown creeper sings an unusually

the mountains of North Carolina and Massachusetts
north to southern Canada; also in the
mountains of western North America from Alaska to

</blockquote>
<p>The Brown Creeper should inherit the earth, for he
is one of the most perfect examples of meekness
that may be found. Small, slight, self-effacing, untiring
in his work, he reminds one of a quiet industrious person
who performs unremittingly small tasks that amount to a
large total.</p>
<p>He is a searcher for insect-eggs, and for insects so small
that they might escape the notice of eyes not peculiarly
fitted to espy them. His long bill is slender enough to
slip into crevices which neither nuthatches nor woodpeckers
investigate. Possibly it is because he selects such tiny
particles of food that he must work so industriously in order
to get enough to eat. He seems always in a hurry.
Mr. Frank Chapman has humorously described the brown
creeper as follows:</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img src="images/i125.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="718" />
<p class="caption">BROWN CREEPER</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;After watching him for several minutes, one becomes
impressed with the fact that he has lost the only thing in
the world he ever cared for, and that his one object in life
is to find it. Ignoring you completely, with scarcely a
pause, he winds his way in a preoccupied, near-sighted
manner up a tree-trunk. Having finally reached the top
of his spiral staircase, one might suppose he would rest
long enough to survey his surroundings, but like a bit of
loosened bark he drops off to the base of the nearest tree
and resumes his never-ending task.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a></p>
<p>The creeper is not easy to find. He is so wonderfully
protected by his dull brown feathers that he looks more
like an animated lichen than a bird. His nest is a cleverly
camouflaged affair, tucked behind loose bark and
often containing eight whitish eggs about the size of
beans.</p>
<p>We are surprised to learn that this patient, hard-working
little creature has the soul of a poet. His sweet nesting
song, reserved for his mate brooding in the woods,
breathes exquisite tenderness and beauty.</p>

<h2>THE STARLING
<br /><i>Starling Family&mdash;Sturnid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 8&frac12; inches.</p>
<p><b>General Appearance</b>: A <i>short-tailed, long-billed black bird</i>
with flecks of brown that look like freckles.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: Head purple, flecked with light brown
spots; body purple and green, the purple predominating
on back and sides, the green on the breast.
In summer, the upper parts and sides are speckled,
the breast and belly dark, and the <i>bill yellow</i>. In
winter, the upper parts are spotted with light brown,
the under parts with white; the bill is <i>brown</i> until
January, when it begins to turn yellow.</p>
<p><b>Notes</b>: Squeaks and gurgles, interspersed with pleasant musical
notes. A flock of starlings make a great deal
of noise.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Numerous starlings live in the Eastern Hemisphere.
A number of them were brought to America in 1890
and released in Central Park, New York City. They
have increased in number and enlarged their range
greatly. They have spread northward and southward;
they are now reasonably common near Boston
and Washington, as well as New York and other
places in the East.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the winter, starlings are easily identified, because
they are the only black birds smaller than crows to be
found in some localities. In the spring, they may be
readily distinguished from grackles because they have
<i>yellow bills</i>, <i>dark eyes</i>, and <i>short, square</i> tails, while
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
grackles have <i>dark</i> bills, <i>yellow</i> eyes, and <i>long</i> tails.
Both starlings and grackles are iridescent; a near view reveals
the spotted plumage of the starlings and the iridescent
bars on the backs of the purple grackles.</p>
<p>Major Bendire says that starlings possess unusual adaptability
and can make their nests in a great variety of
places. Accusations are brought against them for driving
away bluebirds and even flickers. It remains to be
seen how much harm is done to our native birds in this
way.</p>
<p>There are different opinions regarding the economic
value of Old World starlings. Mr. Forbush tells of an
Australian locust invasion near Ballarat, Victoria, which
made terrible havoc with crops. &ldquo;It was feared that all
the sheep would have to be sold for want of grass, when
flocks of Starlings, Spoon-bills, and Cranes made their appearance
and in a few days made so complete a destruction
of the locusts that only about forty acres of grass were
lost.&rdquo; Mr. Forbush gives also &ldquo;the experience of the forest
authorities in Bavaria during the great and destructive
outbreak of the nun moth which occurred there from 1889
to 1891. The flight of Starlings collected in one locality
alone was creditably estimated at ten thousand, all busily
feeding on the caterpillars, pup&aelig; and moths. The attraction
of Starlings to such centers became so great that
market-gardeners at a distance felt their absence seriously.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a></p>
<p>In an article by E. R. Kalmbach of the Biological Survey,
published in &ldquo;The Auk&rdquo; of April, 1922, and entitled
&ldquo;A Comparison of the Food Habits of British and American
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
Starlings,&rdquo; occur the following statements by Dr.
Walter E. Collinge, the eminent Scotch biologist:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Starling offers a most serious menace to the production
of home-grown food, and any further increase in
its numbers can only be fraught with the most serious consequences.&rdquo;
He says also, &ldquo;For many years past there
has been taking place a sure but gradual change of opinion
with reference to the economic status of the Starling,
for from one of our most useful wild birds it has become
one of the most injurious. Its alarming increase throughout
the country threatens our cereal and fruit crops, and
the magnitude of the plague is now fully realized.&rdquo; He
states further, &ldquo;There is fairly reasonable evidence to show
that in the past the bulk of the food consisted of insects
and insect larv&aelig;, slugs, snails, earthworms, millepedes,
weed seeds, and wild fruits; in more recent years, this has
been supplemented by cereals and cultivated fruits and
roots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Kalmbach reports a better record for the starling
in America, and refers to the decision made by the Department
of Agriculture, reported in Bulletin 868:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of the Starling&rsquo;s food habits have been demonstrated
to be either beneficial to man or of a neutral character.
Furthermore, it has been found that the time the
bird spends in destroying crops or in molesting other birds
is extremely short compared with the endless hours it
spends searching for insects or feeding on wild fruits.
Nevertheless, no policy would be sound which would give
the bird absolute protection and afford no relief to the
farmer whose crops are threatened by a local overabundance
of the species.... The individual farmer will be
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
well rewarded by allowing a reasonable number of Starlings
to conduct their nesting operations on the farm.
Later in the season a little vigilance will prevent these
easily frightened birds from exacting an unfair toll for
services rendered.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE NORTHERN SHRIKE OR BUTCHER-BIRD
<br /><i>Shrike Family&mdash;Laniid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: A little over 10 inches.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: Gray above, lighter underneath; forehead,
rump, and upper tail-coverts white; wings black,
irregularly marked with white; tail black, bordered
with white; <i>a heavy black streak extending from the
bill beyond the eye</i>; <i>bill hooked</i> and blackish.</p>
<p><b>Notes</b>: A call-note and a sweet song.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Fields or roadsides where it can find insects, small
rodents, and little birds for its prey.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Northern North America. Breeds from northwestern
Alaska and northern Canada to the base of the
Alaskan Peninsula, Saskatchewan, Ontario, and Quebec;
winters south to central California, Arizona,
New Mexico, Texas, Kentucky, and Virginia.</p>
<p>The <span class="small">LOGGERHEAD SHRIKE</span>, a resident of the Southern
States, is similar to the Northern Shrike but
smaller. It is found from southern Florida to North
Carolina and west to Louisiana. Northward this
species is represented by the <span class="small">MIGRANT SHRIKE</span>, nesting
locally from Virginia and eastern Kansas to the
southern border of Canada.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shrikes or Butcher-Birds are attractive to look at, but
have a habit which renders them extremely unpopular.
They pursue small rodents and little birds and impale
them upon sharp twigs, thorns, or barbed wire fences.
In excuse for these cruel acts, it must be said that they
have not strong, sharp talons like hawks and owls; in order
to tear their prey to pieces, there must be a way of holding
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
it firmly.<a class="fn" id="fr_47" href="#fn_47">[47]</a> One agrees with Mr. Forbush, however, in his
estimate of the habit. He says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Shrike or Butcher-Bird is regarded as beneficial;
but our winter visitor, the Northern Shrike, kills many
small birds. It pursues Tree Sparrows, Juncos, Song
Sparrows, and Chickadees, overtakes and strikes them
while they are in flight, sometimes eating them, but oftener
leaving them to hang on trees, where they furnish food
for other birds. When one sees the little Butcher killing
Chickadees and hanging them up, his faith in its usefulness
receives a great shock. Shrikes are probably of less
value here than in their northern homes, where in summer
they feed much on insects. Their chief utility while here
[in Massachusetts] consists in their mouse-hunting proclivities.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fn_47">[47]</a></p>
<p>Their habit of killing English sparrows and thus getting
rid of a nuisance has been commended. Shrikes are likewise
destroyers of grasshoppers, crickets, beetles, and
other insects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like birds of prey and some other birds, the Butcher-Bird
habitually disgorges the indigestible part of its food
after digesting the nutritive portion. The bones and hair
of mice are rolled into compact pellets in the stomach
before being disgorged.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_48" href="#fn_48">[48]</a></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTIONS AND BIOGRAPHIES
<br />OF
<br />OUR EARLY SPRING BIRDS
<br />PART THREE</h2>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<h2 id="c6">EARLY SPRING BIRDS</h2>
<p>On a mild day late in February or early in March,
before winter is really over and snow has entirely
disappeared, one may hear the cheerful voice of the song
sparrow, the welcome chirp of the robin, or the sweet note
of the bluebird. Even though ice and snow return, courage
is renewed with the advent of winged messengers who
presage the ever fresh miracle of spring, and who hold
home-love in their hearts so strong that they brave cold
and distance to return to the &ldquo;Land of Their Hearts&rsquo; Desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the season advances, other birds arrive. A &ldquo;dusky
line&rdquo; of wild geese &ldquo;honk&rdquo; noisily; flocks of grackles
&ldquo;creak&rdquo; from the pines; red-winged blackbirds join the
hylas in awakening the marshes; ph&oelig;bes call disconsolately
for their mates; fox sparrows, chewinks, and white-throats
sing melodiously from thickets; cowbirds appear
in fields, which ring with the clear songs of meadowlarks
and the tender notes of field and vesper sparrows.
Mourning doves coo gently to each other; chipping sparrows
make their homes in our gardens; kingfishers sound
their rattles; flickers and red-headed woodpeckers raise
their loud voices. The hills &ldquo;clap their hands with joy&rdquo;;
the earth shows a flush of green and gold; trees and shrubs
are touched with colors more exquisite than in autumn;
wild-flowers carpet the woods and fields, and brooks join
in the chorus of bird-song.</p>
<p>As the birds appear, it is not difficult to distinguish
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
them, if one begins before the great migration of late
April or early May, and goes forth with alert senses and
infinite patience and perseverance. With a reliable guide-book,
a learner may be reasonably sure of the early
migrants, because only certain species of large and confusing
families are to be found during March and early
April.</p>
<p>In watching birds, a student learns to observe with lightning
speed; to note color and comparative size; distinguishing
marks such as crests or striped crowns, spots on
breast or throat, bars on wings or tail; the length and
shape of bill, wings, tail, and legs. He learns also to
notice whether the bird walks, runs, hops, or &ldquo;teeters&rdquo;;
whether its flight is swift or slow, direct like a robin&rsquo;s, undulating
like a goldfinch&rsquo;s, soaring like that of hawks
and eagles, labored or jerky like woodpeckers&rsquo;, or graceful
and &ldquo;skimming&rdquo; like that of swallows.</p>
<p>A careful observer notices also whether the bird was
seen in a plowed field or a grassy pasture; by a roadside
or in a thicket; in an orchard or an open grove; in deep
woods or coniferous forests; in a treetop, on a tree-trunk,
on the ground; near a stream, a pond, or a marsh; near a
sandy or a rocky shore; in an arid region, or among mountains.</p>
<p>A sure means of identification for many species is the
song or the call-note. The songs of some birds are similar
to those of others, but there is usually a characteristic note
or strain. When beginning my study of birds, I traced
every sound I could to its source, waited till I saw the
author of the note or song, listened till I learned it, could
reproduce it, or at least be sure of future recognition. I
found that the training of my sense of hearing opened an
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
avenue of enjoyment of which I had been utterly unconscious;
many others testify to a similar pleasure. Thoreau
speaks repeatedly of his joy in sound and even in
silence. Truly the voice of God may thus be heard and
His infinite power further revealed.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the earliest arrivals in the
spring are the last to migrate in the fall. The reason is
the food-supply. The insectivorous birds arrive later and
leave earlier than those that have a more varied diet. An
unusually severe winter sends birds south of their usual
winter range.</p>
<p>The dates of migration must necessarily vary with latitude.
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
Migrants arrive near Washington a week or two
earlier than near New York City, and near Boston a few
days later. The lateness of the spring sometimes causes
a delay of a week or two. The May arrivals appear more
nearly on schedule. After May 15 birds begin to decrease
in number, the &ldquo;Transient Visitors&rdquo; passing farther
north; by June 5 we have with us our &ldquo;Permanent Residents&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Summer Residents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the fall the mildness of a season may cause November
migrants to remain into December, or an open winter
may tempt those that habitually migrate only a short distance
to remain north of their usual winter range.</p>

<h2>THE AMERICAN ROBIN
<br /><i>Thrush Family&mdash;Turdid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: 10 inches.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Head black; bill yellow; a white spot above and below
eye; throat white, streaked with black; back and
wings gray; tail black, with white spots near tips of
outer feathers; white beneath tail; entire breast and
sides reddish-brown; color less brilliant in autumn
and winter, and bill darker.</p>
<p><b>Young Female</b>: Paler than male.</p>
<p><b>Young</b>: Similar to female, except for speckled breasts and
backs.</p>
<p><b>Call-note</b>: A sharp <i>tut</i>, used to express anger or alarm; also
a sweet tender note, with which it encourages its
young or converses with its mate.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A loud, clear morning song, <i>Cheer-up, cheer-up, cheer-up,
cheer-up</i>, sweeter and more subdued toward
evening. The song varies decidedly with different
individuals. Many robins seem to enjoy improvisations;
we may hear them sing their somewhat monotonous
strain with pleasing variations. During
their sojourn in the South they sing but little, and
live in flocks remote from human habitations; consequently
they are not loved as they are in the
North.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: North America, breeding from the tree-limit south to
the northern part of the Gulf States and Mexican
tableland; in winter, to Florida and the highlands
of Guatemala.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>None of our birds is so well-known and so universally
beloved as the robin. He, together with the
song sparrow and the bluebird, arrives at a time when we
are weary of winter and yearning for spring. He seems
to show so much eagerness to return to us that he receives
a hearty welcome. He is the first bird that we knew in
childhood, unless it be the English sparrow; our earliest
books were filled with tales and poems concerning him.
Most of us have a fund of anecdotes that we could relate.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig14">

<p class="caption">ROBIN</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>A robin has distinct individuality. His is a many-sided
nature. He is cheerful and optimistic, aggressive and
fearless, pugnacious and ardent&mdash;like the brave Lochinvar,
&ldquo;so daring in love and so dauntless in war,&rdquo;&mdash;yet
withal tender, joyous, and lovable. He is a fighter at
mating time, but a gentle husband.</p>
<p>There are few bird-choruses as sweet as robins&rsquo; rain-song
or even-song. I recall a flock of these happy birds
singing from maple-tops in a little village nestled beside
a brawling river, when patches of brown earth showed beneath
melting snow, and heavy rain-clouds broke away
to reveal a golden western sky. The robins sang with the
joy that my own heart felt at the renewal of life on the
earth. I once heard their even-song in an elm-shaded college-town
of Massachusetts during a lovely Sunday evening
in June, when church-bells rang and robins held a
vesper service all their own. My sister and I walked beneath
the great arched trees and found ourselves speaking
in whispers, as was our habit in the cathedrals of the Old
World.</p>
<p>The robin&rsquo;s <i>tut-tut</i>, or <i>tut-tut-tut&prime;-tut-tut-tut-tut</i>,&mdash;his
scolding note,&mdash;is very similar to the exclamation of reproof
our grandfather used to administer to us for childish
misdemeanors. It is amusing to see how robins use
this form of remonstrance to humans. John Burroughs
wrote that he was kept out of his own summer-house by a
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
female robin that was nesting there. She scolded him so
soundly for trespassing upon his own property, which she
had appropriated, that he could have no peace. He
finally left her in possession till her young had flown.<a class="fn" id="fr_49" href="#fn_49">[49]</a>
I had a similar experience when picking cherries in a
friend&rsquo;s garden. A robin had preceded me and resented
my intrusion in no uncertain manner. No angry fishmonger
of Billingsgate ever hurled more noisy vituperation
at a thief than did that robin fling at me, especially
when I coolly refused to heed his commands to &ldquo;Keep
Off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I recall an amusing experience with a robin family one
summer. The second brood of hungry babies were clamoring
for &ldquo;More,&rdquo; and following their overworked father
about as I have seen human babies tease their mothers.
He was decidedly &ldquo;frayed&rdquo; as to temper, but he chose to
assume the entire parental responsibility. His faded, bedraggled
spouse, perched disconsolately upon the roof of
the chicken-house, flew down two or three times into the
bosom of the family and endeavored to &ldquo;do her bit&rdquo;; but
her testy husband drove her off each time with a sharp
<i>tut-tut</i>, until in despair she remained upon the ridge-pole
peeping forlornly. The father proceeded to pull up
worms for his gaping brood in a manner so irritated and
strenuous that I wondered whether he had had a &ldquo;family
jar,&rdquo; or was only worn out with anxiety and overwork. It
is a huge task to feed one baby robin alone, who can eat
sixty-eight angleworms a day,<a class="fn" id="fr_50" href="#fn_50">[50]</a> or one hundred and sixty-five
cutworms.<a class="fn" id="fr_51" href="#fn_51">[51]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>Robins do good to the soil by dragging forth earthworms
and preventing their too rapid increase. Mr. Forbush
calls attention to the value of these birds in devouring
&ldquo;dormant cutworms and caterpillars even in February,&rdquo;
also quantities of the larv&aelig; of March flies and white grubs
that injure grass. The robin is an enemy of caterpillars,
especially those that live near the ground; his destruction
of cutworms and white grubs alone entitles him to our
gratitude. He does eat early cherries, and has been bitterly
arraigned for so doing. When later cherries, apples,
peaches, pears, and grapes are ripe, wild fruits and
mulberries which he eats by preference, have also matured;
so on the whole, he does little harm.<a class="fn" id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a> He is now
protected in most of our states.</p>
<p>A Maine robin that had an inordinate love for cherries
and garden-raspberries was at first intimidated by a
most lifelike, well-set-up scarecrow placed in the garden
for his benefit. But he grew wiser as the days passed:
he approached the fearful creature and received no harm.
Familiarity finally bred contempt, for one day he was
discovered perched upon the scarecrow&rsquo;s shoulder eating
a raspberry!</p>
<p>Robins become very tame. I once had the pleasure
of the companionship of a dear, gentle, little English robin&mdash;a
bird very different in size and manner from his
American cousin&mdash;who would come out of the shrubbery
whenever I called him. He would approach within two
or three feet of my chair, to snatch the soft crumbs that
I placed on the ground to lure him. He rewarded me
frequently with his delightful little bubbling song.</p>
<p>An American robin during a March ice-storm learned
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
that bread crumbs were to be found upon the window-sill
of a house in Cleveland. He flew to the sill frequently.
When he found no crumb awaiting him, he would tap
on the pane, then fly away a short distance and remain
until a fresh supply appeared. He and his mate nested
in an apple-tree near by. They and their brood were
fed in this way the entire season by their bird-loving
friends, until they were in danger of becoming pauperized!
One morning the following March while the Cleveland
family were breakfasting, they heard the familiar
tap upon the pane! There was Robin back again&mdash;you
may imagine his welcome! For four years, he continued
to announce his arrival in the same manner, and to build
in the same yard; each year he and his family were supplied
with part of their food by their devoted friends.
Then ill must have befallen him, for he never returned.</p>
<p>To another Ohio woman came the joy of having a robin
enter her room frequently. She had tempted him with
crumbs inside a window-sill. One day he perched upon
the sewing-machine where she was at work, and sang
his sweet song to her, as the busy machine hummed its
tune.</p>
<p>A robin&rsquo;s nest is an untidy affair, but it is something
that we should miss were it not a part of our environment.
Few birds&rsquo; eggs are more lovely in color than those of
the familiar robins&rsquo;-egg blue, nestled in their grass-lined
cup of clay. Olive Thorne Miller wrote of a clever robin
that wished to build her nest during an almost rainless
spring. She could find no mud, so she waded about in
her drinking-dish to wet her legs; she then hopped into
the dust, and with her bill scraped the mud off her legs.
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
This she did repeatedly, until she had the necessary
amount.<a class="fn" id="fr_53" href="#fn_53">[53]</a></p>
<p>I once saw a mother-robin sheltering her brood during
a rainstorm of great violence. Her soft body and outspread
wings were pelted by the rain, but she seemed
quite oblivious to everything except to keep harm from
her young. Her protecting attitude and the look in her
bright eyes made as beautiful an expression of mother-love
as I ever witnessed.</p>

<h2>THE BLUEBIRD
<br /><i>Thrush Family&mdash;Turdid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 6&frac12; to 7 inches.</p>
<p><b>General Appearance</b>: Upper parts bright blue; under parts
reddish-brown; <i>no crest</i>.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Head, back, and tail bright blue; wings blue, edged
with black; in the fall, edged with reddish-brown;
throat, breast, and sides reddish-brown; white from
center of breast to tail.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Similar to male, but paler; wings and tail brightest
in flight.</p>
<p><b>Young</b>: Grayish-blue, speckled with whitish; wings and tail
bluish.</p>
<p><b>Call-note</b>: An indescribably sweet rendering of the syllables,
<i>Cheer-e-o</i>, given usually while the bird is on the
wing.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A gentle warble of exceptional sweetness&mdash;<i>whew&prime;-ee,
whew&prime;-ee, whew&prime;-ee</i>, uttered tenderly and pensively.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Orchards and gardens. The birds are usually seen
in pairs, and like rather conspicuous perches, such
as fence-posts and telegraph wires.</p>
<p><b>Nest</b>: Made of grasses and placed in old hollow trees, preferably
apple-trees. One objection raised against
tree-surgery is that it deprives bluebirds of nesting-sites,
but that objection may be removed by furnishing
nesting-boxes.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern North America. Breeds from southern Canada
and Newfoundland to the Gulf Coast and Florida,
west to the Rockies; winters in the southern half of
the eastern U. S., south to Guatemala.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>As spring approaches, I invariably &ldquo;go a-hunting,&rdquo;
not for &ldquo;rabbit-skins,&rdquo; but for song sparrows and
bluebirds. Robins usually seek us, and sometimes their
blue-winged cousins call <i>Cheer-e-o</i> as they fly swiftly over
our housetops; but I am never happy until I have visited
an orchard or pasture frequented by these heaven-sent
birds. &ldquo;My heart leaps up when I behold&rdquo; once more
their exquisite blue and hear their soft, delightful warble.
Then I know that spring is really on her way, and I
am again eager and expectant.</p>
<p>Bluebirds have always been much beloved, especially
in New England. Florence Merriam writes: &ldquo;Although
the Bluebird did not come over in the Mayflower, it is
said that when the Pilgrim Fathers came to New England
this bird was one of the first whose gentle warblings attracted
their notice, and, from its resemblance to the beloved
Robin Redbreast of their native land, they called
it the Blue Robin.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_54" href="#fn_54">[54]</a></p>
<p>The bluebird has always been a favorite theme for poets
and nature-writers, especially in New England, where the
beauty and warm coloring of this sweet bird seem exceptionally
welcome after a long, severe winter. In Thoreau&rsquo;s
diary, &ldquo;Early Spring in Massachusetts,&rdquo; he refers
to the bluebird thirteen times and writes: &ldquo;The bluebird&mdash;angel
of the spring! Fair and innocent, yet the offspring
of the earth. The color of the sky, above, and of
the subsoil beneath, suggesting what sweet and innocent
melody, terrestrial melody, may have its birthplace between
the sky and the ground.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_55" href="#fn_55">[55]</a></p>
<p>Burroughs, too, makes frequent mention of the bluebird.
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
In &ldquo;Under The Maples&rdquo; he says: &ldquo;None of our
familiar birds endear themselves to us more than does
the bluebird. The first bluebird in the spring is as welcome
as the blue sky itself. The season seems softened
and tempered as soon as we hear his note and see his
warm breast and azure wing. His gentle manners, his
soft, appealing voice, not less than his pleasing hues,
seem born of the bright and genial skies. He is the spirit
of April days incarnated in a bird. Not strictly a songster,
yet his every note and call is from out the soul of
harmony.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_56" href="#fn_56">[56]</a></p>
<p>Bluebirds are of economic as well as &aelig;sthetic value.
They devour cutworms and other kinds of caterpillars,
grasshoppers, crickets, katydids, and beetles. They eat
fruit in the winter; they prefer that taken from pastures,
swamps, and hedgerows, rather than from gardens or orchards.
They never destroy cultivated crops; on the contrary,
benefit them.<a class="fn" id="fr_57" href="#fn_57">[57]</a></p>
<p>These birds are such devoted lovers that one is rarely
seen far from its mate. The female is very gentle and
timid; she seems to need reassurance and protection.
There are times, however, when she knows her own mind
and shows firmness of character. A male bluebird in
Asheville, N. C., intoxicated by the warmth of a sunshiny
January day, wooed a female ardently. She was very
distant and finally dismissed him. She evidently had sufficient
foresight to realize that it would be disastrous to
go to housekeeping so early and therefore withheld her
consent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Numerous instances have been recorded of bluebirds
that have lost their mates by accident and have mourned
so deeply as to touch the heart of any one who saw the
tragedy or heard the cries of sorrow.</p>

<p class="caption">SONG SPARROW</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>The Song Sparrow, like air and sunshine, is a part
of our daily lives after we have once become acquainted
with him. In some localities he takes up his
abode permanently; in others, he arrives in late February
or early March and remains until November. Joy in life
and deep contentment abide with him. He is the most
incurable optimist of my acquaintance. I have heard
him sing beside a brook that has just broken its icy fetters,
while patches of snow still remained on the ground; during
days of rain which silenced most songsters; through
hot summer noons and during the almost songless molting-season,&mdash;nothing
seems to daunt him, from early
morning until sunset. Occasionally during the night is
heard his simple strain, as though he needs must sing in
his sleep.</p>
<p>His song is pleasing, but in no way remarkable. It is
in a major key and lacks the ecstasy and piercing sweetness
of the fox sparrow&rsquo;s, and the exquisite tenderness of
the field and the vesper sparrow&rsquo;s, but it possesses a
charm all its own. It breathes a joy in simple things&mdash;a
steadfast and cheerful courage that makes us say, &ldquo;He,
too, is no mean preacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Song sparrows, like other members of the Finch family,
are of great service in their destruction of insects and
weed seeds, of which they consume enormous quantities.
They eat wild berries and fruits only when their favorite
food is not obtainable. They possess no bad habits and
are desirable &ldquo;bird-neighbors&rdquo; to cultivate. Water always
attracts them; one is most likely to find them near
streams, in which they love to bathe.</p>
<p>Their nests are made largely of grasses, dead leaves,
and root-fibres, and are lined with soft grasses. They
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
are placed in bushes or on the ground. The eggs, pale
in color and flecked with brown, are well concealed by
their markings. Song sparrows, usually serene, grow intensely
nervous when the nest is approached, and betray
its whereabouts by their incessant <i>Chip, chip</i>.</p>

<p><b>Range</b>: North America. Breeds in the forest-regions of Canada
and Alaska; winters from the lower Ohio and
Potomac Valleys to central Texas and northern
Florida.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Never shall I forget the thrill of surprise and ecstasy
which my first fox sparrow brought to me!
My sister and I were on eager quest for early migrants
in open woods and overgrown pastures, when from a
thicket of tall shrubs there burst so marvelous a &ldquo;concord
of sweet sounds&rdquo; that we were spell-bound. No words
can describe the tenderness, the joyous abandon, yet withal
the strain of sadness in the song, as though the choristers
had drunk deep of life, had visioned clearly its secrets,
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
and transmuted its experiences. When the music had become
a soft cadence, we sought the singers, and found a
band of thrush like sparrows scratching in the old brown
leaves like bantam hens. They remained in the thicket
for several days, singing most rapturously toward sunset.</p>
<p>Though shy birds and seen infrequently, fox sparrows
occasionally approach houses. During a deep spring
snow that covered the birds&rsquo; natural food-supply, several
of these north-bound migrants came three times a day
with a flock of juncos to feed on bread-crumbs in our
back yard. Like Tommy Tucker, they &ldquo;sang for their
supper.&rdquo; Twice they arrived before a fresh supply of
crumbs had been scattered; their songs announced their
presence and were accompanied by the gentle trill of the
juncos. A large flock remained in Middlesex Fells for
several days.</p>
<p>Most bird-lovers consider an experience with fox sparrows
as out of the ordinary. Thoreau wrote: &ldquo;Is not
the coming of the fox-colored sparrow something more
earnest and significant than I have dreamed of? These
migrating sparrows bear all messages that concern my
life.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_58" href="#fn_58">[58]</a></p>

<p>When March has lost some of its bluster and gentler
weather prevails, there arrives from the
land of sunshine and teeming insect life, a small brown
and gray bird&mdash;the Ph&oelig;be, first of the Flycatcher family
to come North. Like many of the early migrants, he
travels without his beloved little mate, whom he seems to
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
miss sadly; for he sits disconsolately on a bare twig and
calls her name in hoarse, wheezy tones. After she appears,
it is pleasant to see their devotion, not only to each
other, but to the nesting site. How they journey apart
the great distance from South to North and find their own
especial bridge or barn year after year, is one of the great
mysteries.</p>
<p>Their large, loosely-constructed nest is made of moss
and mud, lined with soft grass, hair, or feathers. It is
usually infested with bird-lice, as I discovered, to my
dismay. It is well not to allow ph&oelig;bes to build where
the lice may become a nuisance.</p>
<p>Like all the soberly-dressed flycatchers, ph&oelig;bes seek
conspicuous perches such as posts or dead branches.
They have the family habit of ruffling up their head-feathers
into a sort of crest, and of jerking their tails frequently,
especially when uttering their note. They make
unexpected sallies after insects, which their unusually
keen eyes can see from dawn until dark.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;bes are among our most useful birds, for they destroy
injurious beetles, weevils, flies that annoy cattle and
horses, house flies, ants, mosquitoes, wasps, spiders, grasshoppers,
and numerous other harmful insects.<a class="fn" id="fr_59" href="#fn_59">[59]</a> Their
soft brown and gray plumage blends with dull March
meadows, with the silver sheen of the brooks they love,
and with silken pussy-willows and brown willow-boughs.</p>
<h3>THE BLACK PH&OElig;BE</h3>
<p>The Black Ph&oelig;be is found from Texas west to the Pacific
coast. It catches flies persistently and well deserves
its family name. In appearance it resembles the slate-colored
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
junco, for it has a dusky head, back, wings, tail,
and breast, with a white belly. Professor Beal writes
of this bird as follows: &ldquo;The black ph&oelig;be has the same
habits as its eastern relative, both as to selection of food
and nesting sites, preferring for the latter purpose some
structure of man, as a shed, or, better still a bridge over
a stream of water, and the preference of the black ph&oelig;be
for the vicinity of water is very pronounced. One may
always be found at a stream or pool and often at a
watering-trough by the roadside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Careful study of the habits of the bird shows that it obtains
a large portion of its food about wet places. While
camping beside a stream in California the writer took
some pains to observe the habits of the black ph&oelig;be. The
nesting season was over, and the birds had nothing to do
but eat. This they appeared to be doing all the time.
When first observed in the morning, at the first glimmer
of daylight, a ph&oelig;be was always found flitting from rock
to rock, although it was so dusky that the bird could hardly
be seen. This activity was kept up all day. Even in
the evening, when it was so dark that notes were written
by the aid of the camp fire, the ph&oelig;be was still engaged
in its work of collecting, though it was difficult to understand
how it could catch insects when there was scarcely
light enough to see the bird. Exploration of the stream
showed that every portion of it was patrolled by a ph&oelig;be,
that each one apparently did not range over more than
twelve or thirteen rods of water, and that sometimes two
or three were in close proximity.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_60" href="#fn_60">[60]</a></p>

<h2>THE CROW BLACKBIRD OR PURPLE GRACKLE
<br /><i>American Blackbird Family&mdash;Icterid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: 12 to 13&frac12; inches. Tail about 5 inches long, nearly
the length of that of the blue jay.</p>
<p><b>General Appearance</b>: A glossy black bird with <i>yellow eyes</i>,
and a <i>long tail</i> that in flight resembles a pointed fan
curving toward the midrib. Blackbirds <i>walk</i> instead
of <i>hopping</i>.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Black with beautiful iridescence; head, neck, throat, and
breast with green, blue, and purple reflections; back
and rump purple and green, with iridescent bars;
wings and tail purplish; under parts duller.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Duller than male, with less iridescence.</p>
<p><b>Call-note</b>: A hoarse, loud <i>Chack</i>.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A disagreeable grating noise that Mr. Forbush likens
to the &ldquo;rather musical creaking of a rusty hinge.&rdquo;
I once noticed the strong resemblance of the sound
to the squeaking wheels of farm-wagons that passed
near a noisy flock of grackles. Blackbirds always
look unhappy and uncomfortable when making their
attempt at singing, as though they emitted the sound
with great difficulty.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Groves of pine and spruce, as dark and gloomy as
the birds themselves. They are found in parks and
meadows, on lawns and near buildings. They live
in large flocks except at nesting time.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Middle Atlantic coast-region of the United States.
Breed from north shore of Long Island Sound (rarely
in Massachusetts), the middle Hudson Valley west to
the Alleghanies, and south to the uplands of Georgia,
Alabama, and eastern Tennessee; winter mainly
south of the Delaware Valley. The Bronzed and
Florida grackles extend the range over the whole of
eastern North America, to Great Slave Lake, Newfoundland,
Colorado, and Florida.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>It seems incredible that blackbirds should belong to
the same family as sweet-voiced meadowlarks, gay
bobolinks, and musical orioles. They are literally the
&ldquo;black sheep&rdquo; of the family, with a plumage in keeping
with their dark deeds, and a sinister expression that
arouses suspicion and wins them few friends. Their
habit of destroying birds&rsquo; eggs and young birds makes
them a terror to their neighbors. Dr. Frank Chapman
humorously says that he &ldquo;can imagine bird-mothers frightening
their young into obedience by threatened visits from
that ogre, the Grackle.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_61" href="#fn_61">[61]</a> I saw a flock of them invading
the seclusion of Wade Park, Cleveland, one spring morning.
Two irate robins drove three bandit blackbirds away
from their nest with loud cries and swift pursuit. A few
minutes later, I saw a wood thrush attack a grackle. She
administered a severe blow upon his shoulder, which disarranged
his feathers and left him in such evident pain
as to be quite oblivious of my proximity. This habit of
devastating nests is not, however, so general as has been
supposed, for Professor Beal reports that &ldquo;remains of
birds and birds&rsquo; eggs amount to less than half of one per
cent. of his diet.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_62" href="#fn_62">[62]</a></p>
<p>During the breeding season, grackles do much good
by their destruction of insects upon which their young
are almost wholly fed. They devour beetles, the caterpillars
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
of gypsy and brown-tail moths, cutworms, grasshoppers,
and locusts in great numbers. They &ldquo;follow
the plow&rdquo; in search of the grubs and worms to be found
in the up-turned earth.</p>
<p>Grackles are in great disfavor, however, because of
the grain they consume. Professor Beal states that grain
is eaten during the entire year except for a short time in
the summer. Waste kernels are consumed during winter
and early spring, but that eaten in July and August
is probably standing grain. Middle-western farmers suffer
considerably.<a class="fn" id="fr_63" href="#fn_63">[63]</a></p>
<p>It is interesting to see blackbirds migrate. They fly
in flocks thousands strong. Mr. Forbush tells of a
flock which formed a black &ldquo;rainbow of birds&rdquo; that
stretched from one side of the horizon to the other. There
seemed to be &ldquo;millions&rdquo; of them.</p>
<p>They fly with wonderful precision, like a well-trained
army bent on destruction. They are truly &ldquo;Birds of a
feather&rdquo; that &ldquo;flock together&rdquo; with a kind of joyless
loyalty, disliked by most of the world.</p>
<h3>THE BRONZED GRACKLE</h3>
<p>The Bronzed Grackle, like the Purple Grackle, has a
purple head, but has a <i>bronzed back without iridescent
bars</i>. It is found in central and eastern North America
from Great Slave Lake to Newfoundland in Canada, south
to Montana and Colorado, (east of the Rockies), and southeast
to the northern part of the Gulf States, western Pennsylvania,
New York, and Massachusetts. It winters
mainly from the Ohio Valley to southern Texas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<h3>THE FLORIDA GRACKLE</h3>
<p>The Florida Grackle is abundant from South Carolina
to Florida, and west along the Gulf Coast to southeastern
Texas. It is similar to the Purple Grackle in appearance,
but is smaller in size. Flocks of these grackles frequent
groves of palmettoes and live-oaks.</p>
<h3>THE BOAT-TAILED GRACKLE</h3>
<p>The Boat-tailed Grackle, the largest member of the
blackbird family, (16 inches long), has wonderful violet
reflections on head and neck. The female is much
smaller and is brownish. This grackle is found in the
South Atlantic and Gulf States from Chesapeake Bay to
Florida and west to the eastern coast of Texas, and like
the red-winged blackbird seems to prefer the vicinity of
water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<h2>THE RED-WINGED BLACKBIRD
<br /><i>American Blackbird Family&mdash;Icterid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 9&frac12; inches; length varies in different individuals.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Jet black, except shoulders, which are <i>scarlet</i> edged
with <i>yellow</i>; plumage mottled in winter&mdash;upper parts
edged with rusty brown; bill long, sharp-pointed,
black; legs and feet black; eyes dark.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Head and back blackish, rusty brown, and buff.
Light streak over and under eye; throat yellowish;
under parts streaked with black and white; wings

but attractive on close inspection.</p>
<p><b>Young Males</b>: Similar to females, but with red and black
shoulders.</p>
<p><b>Call-Note</b>: A hoarse <i>chuck</i> resembling that of the grackle.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A liquid, pleasant <i>o-ka-ree</i>.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t4">In meadows where a streamlet flows</p>
<p class="t5">Or sedges rim a pool,</p>
<p class="t4">There swings upon a blade of green</p>

a &ldquo;hanging&rdquo; nest.</p>
<p><b>Eggs</b>: Pale bluish, with inky scrawls and spots.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: North America, east of the Great Plains, except the

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>When the hylas begin to pipe in the spring, they
are joined by the musical Redwings. The
voices of these birds have been likened to flutes, also to
violincellos in an orchestra. Their song is pleasant to
hear, but seems to require considerable effort on the part
of the performers&mdash;they lift their shoulders and spread
their tails into broad fans when singing.</p>
<p>Redwings are noisy chatterers; they are intensely social
in their nature. It is thought that some males have several
wives at a time&mdash;one marvels at their courage! During
the winter the females flock by themselves, and in the
spring migrate about two weeks after their venturesome,
prospective husbands have come northward. When they
arrive, there is great &ldquo;Confusion of Tongues&rdquo;&mdash;the marsh
is transformed into a Babel. Then sites for homes are
selected, and house-building begins in earnest. Blackbirds
make devoted parents.</p>
<p>They are much more popular than their cousins, the
grackles, though in some localities where they are very
abundant, as in the Upper Mississippi Valley, they are
in disfavor because of the grain they devour. They eat
oats, corn, and wheat, but only one-third as much as do
the grackles; they eat the seeds of smartweed and barnyard
grass in preference. Grasshoppers they consider
great delicacies, also many other harmful insects.<a class="fn" id="fr_64" href="#fn_64">[64]</a> Professor
Beal states that nearly seven-eighths of their food
consists of weed seed and insects injurious to agriculture.
He pleads for their protection as does Mr. Forbush, who
says: &ldquo;Should there be an outbreak of cankerworms in
an orchard, the blackbirds will fly at least half a mile to
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
get them for their young.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_65" href="#fn_65">[65]</a> They eat little fruit and do
slight harm to garden or orchard. On the whole, they
are beneficial to mankind.</p>
<p>The <span class="small">RUSTY BLACKBIRD</span> and the <span class="small">YELLOW-HEADED BLACKBIRD</span>
are two other species of blackbirds.</p>
<p>The <span class="small">RUSTY BLACKBIRD</span> resembles both the purple
grackle and the redwing. It is more nearly uniformly
glossy black in summer than the former; it is rusty in
winter like the latter. It is about the size of the redwing
and has a sweeter voice. It is sometimes mistaken for
the grackle; but its smaller size, its shorter, rounder tail,
and more musical voice differentiate it.</p>
<p>The <span class="small">YELLOW-HEADED BLACKBIRD</span>, our western species,
is easy to identify because of his yellow head, neck,
throat, and breast, and his black body, with white wing-patches.
The female has a paler yellow head, which,
with the breast, is marked with white.</p>
<p>The Yellowhead lives in swamps of the Mississippi Valley
from Indiana westward to California. He is attractive
to see, but not pleasant to hear. He, too, is a grain-thief
and therefore unpopular.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 8 inches.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Glossy black, with a brown head, neck, and breast;
some metallic reflections on body, tail, and upper
wing-feathers. <i>Smaller than the grackle</i>, with a
shorter tail, less iridescence, and <i>dark eyes</i>. Like the
grackle, the cowbird is a walker.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Dark brown, with a grayish tinge; under parts
lighter, especially the throat, which has two dark
streaks outlining the light patch.</p>
<p><b>Call-note</b>: A loud <i>chuck</i>.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: No real song, only a disagreeable gurgle, that is emitted
with great effort.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Pastures and open woodlands; usually seen on the
ground, but sometimes in trees.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: North America. Breeds in central Canada, south to
northern California, Nevada, northern New Mexico,
Texas, Louisiana, and North Carolina; winters from
southeast California and the Ohio and Potomac Valleys
to the Gulf Coast and Central Mexico.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The four common black birds&mdash;crows, grackles, redwings,
and cowbirds&mdash;all have sins laid at their
doors. Crows and blackbirds are grain-thieves and destroyers
of the eggs and young of other birds; redwings
have been accused of polygamy and theft; but if judged
by human standards, none compare with cowbirds in what
might be called moral degeneracy. Cowbirds not only
mate promiscuously, but unlike blackbirds, have no regard
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
for their own young. They are like the human
mothers who lay their babies on doorsteps, depart, and
let others rear them.</p>
<p>It is a well-known fact that the female cowbird always
selects the nest of a bird smaller and weaker than herself
in which to deposit her egg. Major Bendire lists ninety-one
varieties of birds that have been thus outraged, frequent
victims being the song sparrow, indigo bunting, parula
warbler, yellow warbler, vireo, chipping sparrow,
towhee, oven-bird, yellow-breasted chat, and even the tiny
blue-gray gnatcatcher. From one to seven cowbirds&rsquo; eggs
have been found at a time in other birds&rsquo; nests, often in
the warm center of the nest. Unless the little bird should
build a new floor, or abandon her nest entirely, the cowbird
egg will hatch first, and the lusty changeling will demand
the lion&rsquo;s share of food and attention. Frequently
the other eggs do not hatch; if they do, the young birds
often perish with hunger and cold. When young cowbirds
have been reared by their patient little foster-parents, they
leave their benefactors and join flocks of their disreputable
relatives.</p>
<p>In justice it must be said that cowbirds, like all villains,
have a redeeming trait&mdash;they are great destroyers of weed
seeds and insects. Like Cadmus and his band, they &ldquo;Follow
the Cow,&rdquo; and enjoy the insects that she arouses as
she walks about in pastures. When the cow lies down,
they, too, pause; they have been known to hop upon her
back in friendly fashion. Self-interest prompts them,
however, for they know that they may find there a harvest
of insects.</p>

<h2>THE MEADOWLARK
<br /><span class="sc">Called also Field Lark and Old Field Lark</span>
<br /><i>American Blackbird Family&mdash;Icterid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 10&frac34; inches, a little larger than the robin;
bill 1&frac12; inches.</p>
<p><b>General Appearance</b>: A large brown bird, with a <i>short tail
that shows conspicuous white feathers</i> at each side
in flight. The bright yellow breast crossed by a
black crescent is less frequently seen.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: Upper parts dark brown, mottled with
black and buff; head striped, with a light line
through the center and a yellow line over each eye,
alternating with two dark stripes; cheeks gray;
throat, breast, and belly yellow; a V-shaped band
on breast; sides and lower part of belly whitish,
streaked with black; bill long and sharp; tail short,
(about 3 inches); outer tail-feathers almost entirely
white; middle feathers brown, barred with black.</p>
<p><b>Call-note</b>: A sharp nasal <i>Yerk</i>, and a twitter that sounds like
a succession of rapid sneezes.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A loud, clear, sweet refrain that usually consists of
four syllables, but sometimes of five or six. It has
been interpreted in various ways as follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t4"><i>Spring&prime;-of&mdash;the-y-e&prime;-a-r!</i></p>
<p class="t4"><i>I love&mdash;you d-e-a-r.</i></p>
<p class="t4"><i>I&rsquo;m Mead&prime;-ow-lar&prime;-rk.</i></p>
</div>
<p class="bq">Mr. T. Gilbert Pearson tells of a lazy darky down
South who interpreted the lark&rsquo;s song as</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t4">&ldquo;<i>Laziness-will kill&prime; you.</i>&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_66" href="#fn_66">[66]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p><b>Flight</b>: Direct, yet fluttering; usually away from the observer,
showing the brown back and white tail-feathers, as
though the bird was conscious of its bright yellow
breast.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Cultivated meadows, and grassgrown fields, especially
one containing a running brook for drinking
and bathing. Its fondness for unmown fields has
given it the name of &ldquo;Old Field Lark.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_67" href="#fn_67">[67]</a></p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern North America. Breeds from eastern Minnesota
and southern Canada, south to northern Texas,
Missouri, and North Carolina, and west to western
Iowa, eastern Kansas, and northwestern Texas;
winters regularly from southern New England
and Ohio valley south to the Gulf States, and
north locally to the Great Lakes and southern
Maine.</p>
<p class="bq">In the South, from southern Illinois, southwestern
Indiana and North Carolina to the coast of Texas,
Louisiana, and southern Florida is found the <span class="small">SOUTHERN

<p class="bq">In the West, from British Columbia to Manitoba

its eastern relative in habits and plumage, but very
different as to song. Its pure, sweet, liquid notes
are among my most delightful memories of western
birds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is fortunate that no human being or bird is possessed
of all the virtues and charms, and that every
individual may hold his own place in our interest and
affections. As the spring migrants arrive, each receives
a welcome peculiarly his own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The lark is so brimful of gladness and love&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">The green fields below him, the blue sky above,</p>
<p class="t0">That he sings and he sings and forever sings he,</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;I love my love, and my love loves me.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_68" href="#fn_68">[68]</a></p>
</div>
<p>His voice, clear and sweet, rings out joyously across
the fields, fragrant with up-turned earth and bright with
sunshine. He is the delight of spring meadows as Bob
White is of summer fields.</p>
<p>The meadowlark has many friends: those who love him
for his winning ways&mdash;his brightness, cheerfulness, and
devotion to his family; epicures, ignorant of his value
or fond only of their own pleasure; and people who realize
that he is of enormous economic importance.</p>
<p>He was formerly believed to be a destroyer of grain.
He was accused of pulling up as much corn and oats as
crows, and of eating clover seed; but he is now recognized
as &ldquo;one of the most useful allies of agriculture, standing
almost without a peer as a destroyer of noxious insects.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_69" href="#fn_69">[69]</a></p>
<p>So untiring is he in his search, that he uses his long
sharp bill, even while snow is on the ground, to probe the
earth for larv&aelig;. He rids the fields of grasshoppers,
crickets, beetles, caterpillars, flies, spiders, and &ldquo;thousand-legs.&rdquo;
Grasshoppers are his favorite delicacy. Professor
Beal states that these insects form three-fourths of the
meadowlark&rsquo;s food during August. He eats also large
numbers of the white grubs of beetles &ldquo;which are among
the worst enemies of many cultivated crops, notably
grasses and grains, and to a less extent of strawberries
and garden vegetables.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fn_69">[69]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Like the quail, meadowlarks destroy weed seeds, which
are eaten mostly in winter. When insects are obtainable,
they are greatly preferred.</p>
<p>A search for a meadowlark&rsquo;s nest is an exciting adventure
that keeps one alert. It is usually found by accident,
perhaps after the wary builder has ceased trying to deceive
the searcher. A sight of the speckled eggs or young
fledglings in their cozy home with a grass-arched doorway
is not soon forgotten.</p>
<p>Unlike quail, baby meadowlarks are unable to run
about as soon as they are out of the egg, but remain
for two weeks in their cleverly camouflaged home, where
they are often the prey of snakes and other enemies.
Meadowlarks are now being widely protected, for many
farmers regard them as one of their greatest assets.</p>

<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
States east of the Rockies and southward to the Gulf
Coast and Texas in the winter. Resident in the U. S.
except in the more northern parts.</p>
<p class="bq">The <span class="small">SOUTHERN FLICKER</span>, a resident as far south as
southern Florida and central Texas, is <i>smaller</i> and
<i>darker</i> than the Northern Flicker.</p>
<p class="bq">The <span class="small">RED-SHAFTED FLICKER</span>, a western species, has
<i>red cheek-patches</i> instead of <i>black</i>, <i>red wing</i> and <i>tail</i>
feathers, instead of <i>yellow</i>; it <i>lacks</i> the <i>red band</i> on
the <i>head</i>. It is found in the Rocky Mt. and Pacific
Coast regions from British Columbia to Mexico, and
east to western Texas, Nebraska, and South Dakota.
In regions where the northern flicker also is found,
these two species have hybridized. In the National
Museum of Washington there are numerous specimens
of these hybrids, where the red and black
cheek-patches, the red and yellow wing-feathers and
red band on the head appear in various unusual combinations.</p>

<p>The Flicker is a bird of distinction. A glimpse of
him at once arouses interest, curiosity, and a desire
for further acquaintance. He is handsome, well set
up, full of vitality and power&mdash;the personification of efficiency.</p>
<p>We like his cheerful voice&mdash;a trifle too loud for a gentleman
of refinement, but a welcome sound in the season
when the whole world wishes to shout with joy at the release
from winter&rsquo;s confinement. Thoreau wrote: &ldquo;Ah,
there is the note of the first flicker, a prolonged, monotonous
<i>wick-wick-wick-wick-wick-wick</i>, etc., or, if you please,
<i>quick, quick, quick</i>, heard far over and through the dry
leaves. But how that single sound peoples and enriches
all the woods and fields. They are no longer the same
woods and fields that they were. This note really quickens
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
what was dead. It seems to put life into the withered
grass and leaves and bare twigs, and henceforth the days
shall not be as they have been. It is as when a family,
your neighbors, return to an empty house after a long
absence, and you hear the cheerful hum of voices and
the laughter of children.... So the flicker makes his
voice ring.... It is as good as a house-warming to all
nature.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_71" href="#fn_71">[71]</a></p>
<p>We cannot repress a smile as we watch this golden-winged
woodpecker striving to make a favorable impression
upon Miss Flicker. He and a group of rivals take
amusing, awkward attitudes, make a variety of noisy but
pleasant calls, and without any ill-tempered quarreling,
select their mates and &ldquo;live happily ever after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though a woodpecker, the flicker departs from family
habits and traditions by seeking his livelihood on the
ground in preference to tree-trunks. He is a foe to the
industrious ant that we were taught to admire along with
the &ldquo;busy bee.&rdquo; But ants destroy timber, infest houses,
and cause the spread of aphids that are enemies of garden
plants; therefore the ant&rsquo;s destroyer, the flicker, is a neighborhood
benefactor and deserves our heartfelt protection.
Professor Beal reports finding 3,000 ants in the stomach
of each of two flickers and fully 5,000 in that of another.<a class="fn" id="fr_72" href="#fn_72">[72]</a>
These insects form almost half of this bird&rsquo;s food. His
long, sticky tongue is especially adapted to their capture.
He likes grasshoppers, crickets, beetles, and caterpillars,
and while he enjoys fruit, he takes little that is of any
value to man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>Most northern flickers migrate. They remain during
the winter in some localities, as Cape Cod, where food is
sufficiently abundant. Mr. Forbush tells of flickers that
have bored holes in summer cottages on the Cape, and
spent the winters in rooms which they damaged by their
habit of &ldquo;pecking.&rdquo; He states that bird-boxes containing
large entrances placed on the outside of the houses
or on the trees near by, would have prevented those flickers
from forming the &ldquo;criminal habit of breaking and entering.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_73" href="#fn_73">[73]</a>
Red-Shafted Flickers have also been found guilty
of the same crime, and have entered not only dwellings,
but school-houses and church steeples.<a class="fn" id="fr_74" href="#fn_74">[74]</a></p>
<p>Though rather shy birds, they often approach inhabited
houses and frequently cause amusing situations because
of their regular drumming on roof or wall. In Florida,
a young woman whom I know was once aroused from her
early morning&rsquo;s sleep by a flicker&rsquo;s knock, and drowsily
responded with a &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; A friend and I, spending
a week-end in an Ohio summer cottage that possessed no
alarm-clock, asked to be called in time for a very early
boat. We heard a knocking, arose, dressed quietly to
avoid disturbing the household, and then found that our
summons had come from flickers on the roof, and that
we had lost about two hours of precious morning&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>Flickers have more local names than almost any other
bird. Over one hundred names have been recorded, of
which &ldquo;Yellowhammer,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Golden-winged Woodpecker,&rdquo;
are perhaps most common.</p>

<h2>THE RED-HEADED WOODPECKER
<br /><i>Woodpecker Family&mdash;Picid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 9&frac34; inches; nearly as large as a robin.</p>
<p><b>General Appearance</b>: A black and white bird <i>with entire head
and neck bright red</i>.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: Head, neck, throat, and upper part of the
breast brilliant red; upper part of back and wings
black; longer wing-feathers or primaries also black;
lower back and secondary wing-feathers white; under
parts white; tail pointed, black, margined with
white. In flight, the areas of red, black, and white
are very distinct.</p>
<p><b>Young</b>: Brown heads and necks, mottled with black; upper
parts of backs barred with light brown. The other
parts of their bodies resemble those of their parents.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: No song, but a loud, cheerful <i>Quir-r-r-k? Quir-r-r-k?</i>
and a drumming sound, similar to that made by
other woodpeckers.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Open woods, groves of beeches preferred.</p>
<p><b>Nest</b>: In hollow tree-trunks or telegraph-poles.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: From southeastern British Columbia, to Ontario, south
to the Gulf Coast, and from central Montana, Colorado,
and Texas east to the valleys of the Hudson
and Delaware; rare in New England. Irregularly
migratory in the northern parts of its range.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This conspicuous bird is one of the handsomest
members of the Woodpecker family. He is the
only one really entitled to the name of Red-Headed Woodpecker.
His male relatives wear only small skull-caps
placed on their crowns at various angles; he possesses
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
a sort of toboggan-cap pulled down over his head and
tucked into his black coat and white vest-front.</p>
<p>Many stories and legends are told of this woodpecker.
He is the delight of children in localities where he is to
be found. I remember how I used to look for the red
hood and the black shawl worn over a white dress, especially
noticeable in flight. I never tired of watching one
of these birds approach his nest in a tall dead tree with
food in his mouth. At a signal from him, his wife&rsquo;s red
head would appear in the doorway. She would emerge;
he would then enter and remain with the children until
her return.</p>
<p>Redheads have not been popular with farmers, who
have accused them of various crimes. They have been
caught eating small fruit and corn on the ear, destroying
both the eggs and young of other birds, and boring holes
in telegraph-poles in which to build their nests. While
individuals may be guilty of such misdemeanors, the redheads
are probably neither so black nor so gory, except
in plumage, as they are painted.</p>
<p>These woodpeckers are not such persistent destroyers
of insects as others of their family. They have a decided
preference for beetles, but eat fewer ants and larv&aelig; than
do the Downy and Hairy woodpeckers. They are exceptionally
fond of vegetable food; their preference for beechnuts
is very great. Dr. C. Hart Merriam states that in
northern New York, where the redhead is one of the commonest
woodpeckers, it subsists almost exclusively on
beechnuts during the fall and winter, even pecking the
green nuts before they are ripe and while the trees are
still covered with leaves. He has shown that these woodpeckers
invariably remain throughout the winter after
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
good nut-yields and migrate whenever the nut-crop fails.<a class="fn" id="fr_75" href="#fn_75">[75]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;In central Indiana during a good beechnut year, from
the time the nuts began to ripen, the redheads were almost
constantly on the wing; passing from the beeches
to some place of deposit. They hid the nuts in almost
every conceivable situation. Many were placed in cavities
in partly decayed trees; and the felling of an old
beech was certain to provide a feast for the children.
Large handfuls were taken from a single knot hole. They
were often found under a patch of raised bark, and single
nuts were driven into cracks in the bark. Others were
thrust into cracks in gate-posts; and a favorite place of
deposit was behind long slivers on fence-posts. In a few
cases grains of corn were mixed with beechnuts. Nuts
were often driven into cracks in the end of railroad ties,
and the birds were often seen on the roofs of houses
pounding nuts into crevices between the shingles. In several
instances the space formed by a board springing away
from a fence was nearly filled with nuts, and afterwards
pieces of bark and wood were brought and driven over
the nuts as if to hide them from poachers.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_76" href="#fn_76">[76]</a></p>
<p>In summer, Dr. Merriam has seen the redheads &ldquo;make
frequent sallies into the air after passing insects, which
were almost invariably secured.&rdquo; He has also seen them
catch grasshoppers on the ground in a pasture.</p>
<p>They are cheerful, active birds, with a call like that of
a giant tree-toad. Their brilliant plumage has unfortunately
made them a good target for sportsmen.</p>

<p><b>Length</b>: About 9&frac12; inches.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: <i>Crown of head and back of neck bright red</i>, resembling
slightly that of the red-headed woodpecker, but
<i>throat and cheeks gray</i>; back and wings barred with
white, the barring reminding one of the flicker.
<i>Under parts gray mashed with red</i>; tail black and
white; upper tail-coverts white, streaked with black.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: <i>Crown gray, nostrils and neck bright red.</i></p>
<p><b>Notes</b>: Mr. Frank Chapman writes of this woodpecker: &ldquo;It
ascends a tree in a curious, jerky fashion, accompanying
each upward move by a hoarse <i>chu-chu</i>. It
also utters <i>k-r-r-r-ring</i> roll and, when mating, a

RED-BELLIED WOODPECKER</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Professor Beal made the following report regarding
this woodpecker: &ldquo;The red-bellied woodpecker
ranges over the eastern United States as far west
as central Texas and eastern Colorado and as far north as
New York, southern Ontario, Michigan, and southern
Minnesota. It breeds throughout this range and appears
to be irregularly migratory. It appears to go north of
its breeding range sometimes to spend the winter. Four
stomachs, collected in November and December, were received
from Canada, and in eight years&rsquo; residence in central
Iowa the writer found the species abundant every winter,
but never saw one in the breeding season. It is rather
more of a forest bird than some of the other woodpeckers,
but is frequently seen in open or thinly timbered country.
In the northern part of its range it appears to prefer deciduous
growth, but in the South is very common in pine
forests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ants are a fairly constant article of diet. The most
are taken during the warmer months. Evidently this bird
does not dig all the ants which it eats from decaying wood,
like the downy woodpecker, but, like the flickers, collects
them from the ground and the bark of trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Florida, the bird has been observed to eat oranges
to an injurious extent. It attacks the over-ripe fruit and
pecks holes in it and sometimes completely devours it.
The fruit selected is that which is dead ripe or partly decayed,
so it is not often that the damage is serious. The
bird sometimes attacks the trunks of the orange trees as
well as others and does some harm. The contents of the
stomachs, however, show that wild fruits are preferred,
and probably only when these have been replaced by cultivated
varieties is any mischief done.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_78" href="#fn_78">[78]</a></p>

<p><b>General Appearance</b>: A medium-sized bird, with <i>bars</i>, <i>stripes</i>,

<p>The Yellow-bellied Sapsucker is the renegade of
the woodpecker family&mdash;the transgressor that has
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
called down anathemas upon all his tribe. He does more
damage in some localities than others. Mr. Forbush reports
that while the sapsucker has undoubtedly killed trees
in northern New England where he breeds, yet in thirty
years he has done no appreciable harm in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Dr. Henry Henshaw, formerly Chief of the Biological
Survey, writes: &ldquo;The Yellow-bellied Sapsucker, unlike
other woodpeckers, does comparatively little good and
much harm.&rdquo; Mr. Henshaw reports 250 kinds of trees
known to have been attacked by sapsuckers and left with
&ldquo;girdles of holes&rdquo; or &ldquo;blemishes known as bird-pecks,
especially numerous in hickory, oak, cypress, and yellow
poplar.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_79" href="#fn_79">[79]</a></p>
<p>The experience of Dr. Sylvester Judd at Marshall Hall,
Maryland, was as follows: &ldquo;In the summer of 1895
there was on the Bryan farm a little orchard of nine apple
trees, about twelve years old, that appeared perfectly
healthy. In the fall sapsuckers tapped them in many
places, and during spring and fall of the next four years
they resorted to them regularly for supplies of sap. Observations
were made (October 15, 1896) of two sapsuckers
in adjoining trees of the orchard. From a point
twenty feet distant they were watched for three hours with
powerful glasses to see whether they fed to any considerable
extent on ants or other insects that were running over
the tree-trunks. In that time one bird seized an ant and
the other snapped at some flying insect. One drank sap
from the holes thirty and the other forty-one times. Later
in the day, one drilled two new holes and the other five.
The holes were made in more or less regular rings about
the trunk, one ring close above another, for a distance of
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
six to eight inches. The drills were about a quarter of
an inch deep, and penetrated the bark and the outer part
of the wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In November, 1900, seven of the nine trees were dead
and the others were dying. The loss of sap must have
been an exhausting drain, but it was not the sole cause
of death. Beetles of the flat-headed apple-borer, attracted
by the exuding sap, had oviposited in the holes, and the
next generation, having thus gained an entrance, had finished
the deadly work begun by the sapsuckers.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_80" href="#fn_80">[80]</a></p>
<p>Mr. W. L. McAtee, of the Biological Survey, made the
following report on sapsuckers: &ldquo;These birds have short,
brushy tongues not adapted to the capture of insects, while
the other woodpeckers have tongues with barbed tips which
can be extended to spear luckless borers or other insects
whose burrows in the wood have been reached by their
powerful beaks. The sapsuckers practically do not feed
on wood-borers or other forest enemies. Their chief insect
food is ants. About 15 per cent. of their diet consists
of cambium and the inner bark of trees, and they
drink a great deal of sap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The parts of the tree injured by sapsuckers are those
that carry the rich sap which nourishes the growing wood
and bark. Sapsucker pecking disfigures ornamental trees,
giving rise to pitch streams, gummy excrescences, and deformities
of the trunks. Small fruit trees, especially the
apple, are often killed, and whole young orchards have
been destroyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These birds inflict much greater financial loss by producing
defects in the wood of the far larger number of
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
trees which they work upon but do not kill. Blemishes
frequently render the trees unfit for anything except
coarse construction and fuel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hickory trees are favorites of sapsuckers. It is estimated
that about 10 per cent. of the merchantable material
is left in the woods on account of bird pecks. On
this basis the annual loss on hickory is about $600,000.
To this must be added the loss on timber by the
manufacturer.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_81" href="#fn_81">[81]</a></p>
<p>It is no wonder that war has been declared upon sapsuckers;
but it is very sad that because of a lack of careful
observation of the distinctive markings of tree-trunk
birds, many useful woodpeckers, especially the Downy
and Hairy, have been sacrificed.</p>
<p>Downy and Hairy Woodpeckers may be readily identified
by a <i>broad white stripe</i> extending down the <i>center</i>
of the <i>back</i>, a <i>small patch</i> of <i>red</i> on the <i>back</i> of the head,
<i>pure white throats</i> and <i>breasts</i>, and wings <i>barred</i> with
white. A <i>red forehead</i> and <i>crown</i> (and red throat of
males), a <i>black crescent across</i> the <i>breast</i>, <i>large white
patches</i> on the <i>wings</i>, a <i>back</i> with <i>black</i> and <i>white bars instead
of a white streak</i>, differentiate this sapsucker from
the Downy and Hairy woodpeckers. The yellow belly is
not a conspicuous &ldquo;field-mark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are several species of sapsucker in the West.
The <span class="small">YELLOW-BELLIED</span> is found in western Texas; the <span class="small">RED-NAPED
SAPSUCKER</span> in the Rocky Mt. region, from British
Columbia to northwestern Mexico, and from Colorado and
Montana to the Cascade and Sierra Nevada Mts.; the <span class="small">RED-BREASTED
SAPSUCKER</span> in the Canadian forests of the <i>Pacific
Coast region</i>, from Alaska to Lower California, east
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>

<h2>THE MOURNING DOVE
<br /><i>Pigeon Family&mdash;Columbid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: Nearly 12 inches; tail 5&frac12; inches.</p>
<p><b>General Appearance</b>: A large, plump, grayish-brown bird,
with a small head, a <i>black mark below the ear</i>, and
a <i>long pointed tail</i>, in contrast to the round, fan-shaped
tail of tame pigeons.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Upper parts a soft grayish-brown, except the head,
which is bluish-gray on the crown, with a pinkish-buff
forehead, and the wings, which have long, gray
primaries. <i>Sides of neck beautifully iridescent</i>, with
a <i>small black spot below</i> the <i>ear</i>, an identification-mark;
black spots on the lower part of breast and
wings; breast with a pinkish tinge, and underneath
the tail pale yellow; tail long and sharply pointed
when the bird is at rest. In flight, it resembles the
jay&rsquo;s in shape; the middle feathers are brown, like
the back; outer feathers largely white; others brown,
tipped with white and banded with black; feet and
legs red.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Duller than male, with less iridescence on neck.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: A soft, monotonous <i>coo-oo-a-coo-o-o</i>, uttered mournfully
and with great tenderness. The sound is
pleasing to some people, but unendurable to
others.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Open woodlands, or fields bordered with trees.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: North America. Breeds chiefly from southern Canada
throughout the United States and Mexico;
winters from southern Oregon, Colorado, the Ohio
Valley, and North Carolina to Panama; casual in
winter in the Middle States.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>Mourning doves, whose &ldquo;billing and cooing&rdquo;
have become proverbial, are as devoted pairs of
lovers as may be found in the bird-world. The ardent
male appears to seek the society of none except his loving
mate. She seems perfectly satisfied with his attentions
and evidently gives him her whole heart.</p>
<p>Madame Dove is a very inefficient housekeeper. Her
nest, built of rough sticks, and notoriously ill-constructed&mdash;is
a sort of platform on which two white eggs are laid.
It is a wonder that they remain in safety long enough to be
hatched, for the nests are often not more than ten feet
from the ground. Were not her twin-babies as phlegmatic
as their parents, they might roll out of bed and come
to an untimely end.</p>
<p>It is fortunate that the easy-going mother does not need
to prepare the bountiful repasts her family demand. She
and her husband select a home-site near fields where weeds
abound and where grain is raised. The family gorge
themselves upon seeds until they almost burst. Mr.
Charles Nash says that &ldquo;these birds are often so full of
seeds that, if a bird is shot, the crop bursts open when it
strikes the ground.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_83" href="#fn_83">[83]</a></p>
<p>They are of enormous economic value. Their food is
almost entirely vegetable, and consists largely of the seeds
of weeds that a farmer must pay to have destroyed or
work hard to eradicate. Doves frequent fields of wheat,
corn, buckwheat, rye, oats, and barley, but the grain they
destroy is only a third of their food, and consists largely
of waste kernels, according to the reports of the Department
of Agriculture.<a class="fn" id="fr_84" href="#fn_84">[84]</a> They like many varieties of infinitesimal
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
seeds that are eschewed by other birds; as
many as 9200 seeds have been found in the stomach of
one dove.</p>
<p>These birds have an unerring instinct for fresh water.
With a peculiar, whistling sound, they fly at nightfall to
a spring or pool for a cool drink before retiring. Hunters
are said to have watched them and thus found springs
for their needs.<a class="fn" id="fr_85" href="#fn_85">[85]</a></p>
<p>Doves eat quantities of gravel to aid in the digestion of
their epicurean feasts. They are fond of dust-baths.
They also indulge in queer, senseless-looking acrobatic
performances, which appear like attempts at gymnastics.</p>

<h2>THE BELTED KINGFISHER
<br /><i>Kingfisher Family&mdash;Alcedinid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 13 inches&mdash;a rather large, stocky bird.</p>
<p><b>General Appearance</b>: A large bluish-gray and white bird,
with a <i>very large crested head</i>, a <i>long bill</i>, and a
short tail.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Bluish-gray above, becoming darker on the wings; a
ragged-looking crest on an unusually large head; a
white spot in front of each large dark eye; small
flecks on the wings; tail bluish-gray, flecked and
barred with white; <i>throat white</i>, a <i>band</i> of <i>white extending
nearly around the</i> neck; a <i>broad band</i> of
<i>bluish-gray extending across the breast</i>; under parts
white, except the sides, which are bluish-gray; feet
relatively small, but with long, strong nails.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Similar to the male, except for a <i>band</i> of <i>reddish-brown
across the breast</i>, extending to the sides, and
forming a fourth belt; a white belt at the throat,
then gray, white, and reddish-brown belts. Unlike
most birds, the female kingfisher is more highly

<p class="caption">KINGFISHER</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>This self-appointed guardian of our streams and
lakes is clad in a suit of gendarme blue. He wears
a sharp two-edged sword in his cap, and carries a rattle
in his throat.</p>
<p>He is a perfect example of &ldquo;Watchful Waiting,&rdquo; as he
sits motionless on a bough overhanging a stream, with
his fierce eyes fixed intently upon the waters beneath him.
When an unwary fish swims by, this blue-coat plunges
after it and spears it with deadly accuracy. If small,
the fish is swallowed whole; if large, it is beaten to death
against a tree, and devoured with difficulty. When fish
are not obtainable, the kingfisher will eat frogs and crustaceans,
and sometimes grasshoppers, crickets, and beetles.
Fish, however, are his favorite food.<a class="fn" id="fr_86" href="#fn_86">[86]</a></p>
<p>The nest is as unusual and interesting as the bird himself.
It consists of a tunnel excavated in a bank by the
long knife-shaped bills of the kingfisher and his mate.
A cavity of good size must be hollowed out to accommodate
so large a bird and a family of from five to eight
lusty youngsters. They are lively and quarrelsome; they
set up a great clamor when Father or Mother arrives
with an already-prepared fish-dinner. Dr. Francis H.
Herrick, in his delightful book, &ldquo;The Home Life of Wild
Birds,&rdquo; tells of his observations of a kingfisher&rsquo;s nest and
nesting habits as follows: &ldquo;The nest had a 4 inch bore;
4 feet from the opening was a vaulted chamber 6 inches
high and 10 inches across....&rdquo;</p>
<p>A series of rattles announced the approach of the parent
bird &ldquo;who came at full tilt with a fish in her bill, making
the earth resound.&rdquo; In response came &ldquo;muffled rattles of
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
five young kingfishers, who issued from their subterranean
abode.... With a rattle in shrillest crescendo, she
bolted right into the hole, delivered the fish, remained for
half a minute, then came out backwards, turning in the
air as she dropped from the entrance, and with a parting
rattle was off to the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were five babies in what Dr. Herrick called the
&ldquo;King Row.&rdquo; They were amusing to look at as they
sat back on their legs; the bill of one nestling protruded
above the shoulder of the bird in front of it. They never
seized their food (fish) of their own accord. &ldquo;It was
necessary to open their bills and press the food well down
into the distensible throats.&rdquo; Raw meat was rejected, but
they throve on fish. &ldquo;Kingfishers&rsquo; throats are lined with
inwardly projecting papillae so that when a fish is once
taken in its throat, it is impossible for it to escape.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_87" href="#fn_87">[87]</a></p>
<p>The young kingfishers that Dr. Herrick observed became
very tame. He is pictured with them on his hand,
his shoulder, and on both knees.</p>
<p>While kingfishers do less good than most of our feathered
benefactors, they do not destroy enough fish to be
a detriment to the fishing interests of lakes and streams.
They are true sportsmen, whose presence we should miss
when we followed the rod and creel. We are forced to
respect their prowess, and we may apostrophize them in
the words of Izaac Walton: &ldquo;Angling is an Art, and you
know that Art better than others; and that this is the truth
is demonstrated by the fruits of that pleasant labor which
you enjoy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some gorgeous but noisy birds, like blue jays, peacocks,
and parrots, please only the eye; many quietly-dressed
but sweet-voiced songsters are a delight to the
ear. To the latter class belongs the Field Sparrow, a
gentle little bird, so rarely seen as to recall to our minds
the lines:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>

</div>
<p>It was several years after I had learned to love the
sweet, tender song of the field sparrow that I had my first
glimpse of the singer. He is a very real and delightful
part of our April meadows, where he lives his serene life.</p>

<p>The Vesper Sparrow is very easy to identify because
of its white tail-feathers. They show conspicuously
as the bird flutters beside hedges that border fields, frequently
keeping just ahead of the observer.</p>
<p>The bird is less attractive in appearance than the other
familiar sparrows, but has to my mind the sweetest voice
of all the sparrows that I know except the fox sparrow.
Its song is pensive and tender, with a spiritual quality
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
that gives it a high rank. The song sparrow&rsquo;s lay usually
consists of three similar notes sung in a major key with
a rising inflection, and followed by a cheerful trill; the
vesper sparrow&rsquo;s song generally has two plaintive notes
preceding a trill, sung in a minor key. It is particularly
beautiful and uplifting when several vesper sparrows are
singing at sunset.</p>

<p><b>Range</b>: North America, from central Canada to Central America;
commonest in the east.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gentle, trustful sparrow is a general favorite.
He is an unobtrusive little bird, seemingly contented
to occupy his place in the world near to the haunts
of man, unconsciously doing his important work without
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
noisy demonstration. Like the brown creeper and the
ph&oelig;be, he is of great economic value; like them, he is not
particularly interesting, and he is without skill as a songster.
But his monotonous trill is a pleasant part of the
spring chorus, and his presence in our yards we should
sorely miss.</p>
<p>Mr. Forbush speaks in high praise of this bird&rsquo;s usefulness.
He claims that the chippy is &ldquo;the most destructive
of all birds to the injurious pea-louse, which caused
a loss of three million dollars to the pea-crop of a single
state in one year.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_88" href="#fn_88">[88]</a> This sparrow eats the grubs that
feed on beet-leaves, cabbages, and other vegetables; he
devours cankerworms and currant worms, besides gypsy,
brown-tail, and tent caterpillars, any one of which would
entitle him to our protection. In the fall, with the decrease
of life in the garden, he takes to the fields, where
like other sparrows he feasts on seeds.</p>
<p>If it were more generally known how invaluable chipping
sparrows are, people would guard them more carefully
from marauding cats. I wish it might become as
unlawful to let cats stalk abroad during the nesting season
as it is to allow unmuzzled dogs to go about freely during
dog-days. I know of a bird-lover near Painesville, Ohio,
who never during nesting-time allowed her pet cat to stir
outside of a good-sized enclosure without a weight attached
to his collar. Some people have put bells on their cats&rsquo;
necks, but while that is efficacious in alarming parent-birds,
it is of no value in preventing the slaughter of
young birds that have just left the nest. Mr. Forbush
has written an appeal, which I wish was more widely
known and heeded. It is called &ldquo;The Domestic Cat&rdquo; and
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
was published under the direction of the Massachusetts
State Board of Agriculture.</p>
<p>Mr. Forbush wrote to such eminent experts and authorities
on bird-life as Robert Ridgway, Dr. Frank M. Chapman,
Dr. Witmer Stone, Dr. Henry W. Henshaw, Dr.
William T. Hornaday, John Burroughs, William Dutcher,
T. Gilbert Pearson, Dr. George W. Field, Dr. C. F. Hodge,
Ernest Harold Baynes, Mrs. Mabel Osgood Wright, and
others, for their opinions regarding the relative destructiveness
of cats to the bird-life of the country. They were
unanimous in their denunciation of cats as the &ldquo;greatest
destructive agency to our smaller song and insectivorous
birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wright says: &ldquo;If the people of the country insist
upon keeping cats in the same number as at present, all
the splendid work of Federal and State legislation, all
the labors of game- and song-bird protective associations,
all the loving care of individuals in watching and feeding,
will not be able to save our birds in many localities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young chipping sparrows are spoiled bird-babies.
They &ldquo;tag&rdquo; their gentle little parents about with unusual
persistence, knowing that they will get what they demand.
They frequently look as if they might not turn out to be
excellent bird-citizens like their ancestors. When a noted
ornithologist first saw Mr. Horsfall&rsquo;s original drawing
of the accompanying family of chipping sparrows he remarked,
&ldquo;That baby looks a million years old and steeped
in sin!&rdquo; But the duties of parenthood sober the youngsters,
and the following year, they become in turn pleasant,
docile, lovable little &ldquo;Bird Neighbors.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The White-crowned Sparrow is considered by some
admirers to be the handsomest member of the sparrow
tribe. It is not widely known in the East, and is
sometimes confused with the white-throat. The gray
throat of the white-crown and the absence of yellow on the
wing and near the eye, distinguish it from the white-throat.</p>
<p>In Bulletin 513 of the Biological Survey occurs this
description of the white-crown: &ldquo;This beautiful sparrow
is much more numerous in the western than in the eastern
States, where indeed it is rather rare. In the East it is
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
shy and retiring, but it is much bolder and more conspicuous
in the far West and often frequents gardens and parks.
Like most of its family it is a seed-eater by preference,
and insects comprise very little more than 7 per cent.
of its diet. Caterpillars are the largest item, with some
beetles, a few ants and wasps, and some bugs, among
which are black olive scales. The great bulk of food,
however, consists of weed seeds, which amount to 74 per
cent. of the whole. In California this bird is accused
of eating the buds and blossoms of fruit trees, but buds
or blossoms were found in only 30 out of 516 stomachs,
and probably it is only under exceptional circumstances
that it does any damage in this way. Evidently neither
the farmer nor the fruit-grower has much to fear from
the white-crowned sparrow. The little fruit it eats is
mostly wild, and the grain eaten is waste.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<h2>THE PURPLE FINCH
<br /><i>Finch Family&mdash;Fringillid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 6&frac14; inches; a little smaller than the English
sparrow.</p>
<p><b>Adult Male</b>: Body largely raspberry- or rose-red, streaked
with brown. For two seasons the male is a brown
sparrowlike bird, with a yellowish-olive chin and
rump; the third season his body seems to have been
washed with a beautiful <i>red, not purple</i>, the color
richest on his head, breast, and rump. Head slightly
crested; bill thick, with bristles at nostrils; cheeks
and back brownish; under parts grayish-white; wings
and tail brownish, edged with red; tail forked.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Decidedly sparrowlike; body grayish-brown, heavily
streaked, lighter underneath; patch of light gray extending
from eye, another from beak; wings dark
grayish-brown, with indistinct gray bands. She is
not unlike the song sparrow, except for the absence
of the three black spots on breast and
throat.</p>
<p><b>Call-note</b>: A sharp, metallic <i>chip</i>.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A clear, sweet, joyous warble.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Woods, orchards, and gardens.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern North America. Breeds in central and southern
Canada, and northern United States, in North
Dakota, central Minnesota, northern Illinois, and
New Jersey, Maine, Massachusetts, the Pennsylvania
mountains, and Long Island; winters from considerably
north of the southern boundary of its breeding-range
to the Gulf Coast, from Texas to Florida.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>None of our smaller finches, except the goldfinch
and indigo bunting are more beautiful in color
than the <span class="small">PURPLE FINCH</span> which wears a Tyrian purple,
rather than the shade we commonly know.</p>
<p>Few members of the family sing more sweetly and
joyously than this songster of the treetops. His delightful
warble resembles somewhat the song of the rose-breasted
grosbeak, and attracts attention wherever the
bird is to be found. Several purple finches singing from
neighboring elm trees at once, makes a May or June concert
not easily excelled. Mr. Forbush says: &ldquo;The song
of the male is a sudden, joyous burst of melody, vigorous,
but clear and pure, which no mere words can do justice.
When, filled with ecstasy, he mounts in air and hangs with
fluttering wings above the trees where sits the one who
holds his affections, his efforts far transcend his ordinary
tones, and a continuous melody flows forth, until, exhausted
with his vocal efforts, he sinks to the level of his
spouse in the treetop. This is a musical species, for some
females sing, though not so well as the males.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_89" href="#fn_89">[89]</a></p>
<p>The bird has been accused of eating the buds of fruit
and shade trees, especially elms, and while he is at times
guilty, he is not condemned by those who know his food-habits
best, but commended for his fondness for weed
seeds, especially ragweed, and for destroying plant-lice,
cankerworms, cutworms, and ground beetles.<a class="fn" href="#fn_89">[89]</a></p>
<p>His cousin, the <span class="small">HOUSE FINCH</span>, or <span class="small">LINNET</span> of California,
who is brighter in color, is more beloved by tourists and
more hated by fruit-growers than almost any bird in the
state. Professor Beal writes: &ldquo;This bird, like the other
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
members of its family, is by nature a seed-eater, and before
the beginning of fruit-growing in California probably
subsisted upon the seeds of weeds, with an occasional
wild berry. Now, however, when orchards have extended
throughout the length and breadth of the state and every
month from May to December sees some ripening fruit,
the linnets take their share. As their name is legion, the
sum total of the fruit that they destroy is more than the
fruit-raiser can well spare. As the bird has a stout beak,
it has no difficulty in breaking the skin of the hardest fruit
and feasting upon the pulp, thereby spoiling the fruit and
giving weaker-billed birds a chance to sample and acquire
a taste for what they might not otherwise have molested.
Complaints against this bird have been many and loud....
Whatever the linnet&rsquo;s sins may be, grain-eating is not
one of them. In view of the great complaint made
against their fruit-eating habit, the small quantity found
in the stomachs taken is somewhat of a surprise. When
a bird takes a single peck from a cherry or an apricot, it
spoils the whole fruit, and in this way may ruin half a
dozen in taking a single meal. That the damage is often
serious no one will deny. It is noticeable, however, that
the earliest varieties are the ones most affected; also, that
in large orchards the damage is not perceptible, while in
small plantations the whole crop is frequently destroyed.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_90" href="#fn_90">[90]</a></p>
<p>In spite of this troublesome habit, the linnet is a most
engaging little bird. Its sweet bubbling song, not unlike
that of the purple finch, adds much to the charm of California.</p>

<p><b>Song</b>: Two notes, followed by a trill. The song may be translated
into <i>chip-chur, pussy-pussy-willow</i>.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Woodlands, where he is first found in April scratching
among old leaves like fox sparrows, white-throats,
and other members of his family.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern North America. Breeds from southern Canada
and Maine to central Kansas and northern
Georgia; winters from southeastern Nebraska, the
Ohio and Potomac Valleys to central Texas, the
Gulf Coast, and southern Florida.</p>
<p class="bq">The <span class="small">WHITE-EYED TOWHEE</span> is found on the Atlantic
Coast region from about Charleston, South Carolina,
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
to southern Florida. He resembles his northern
cousin except that his <i>eyes</i> are <i>white</i>, and that
his wings and tail have <i>less</i> white on them. There
are several species of towhee in our western
states.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before the trees are in leaf, there appears in our
April woods a lively, trim, and attractive bird who
makes himself known in no uncertain manner. So bustling
and energetic is he, so cheerful and self-confident,
without unpleasant aggressiveness, that he always attracts
attention. The uninitiated frequently call him an oriole,
whom he does resemble in having a glossy black head,
throat, back, and tail, and white markings on his wings,
with reddish-brown like that of the orchard oriole on his
sides; but there the resemblance ceases, for the oriole has
in addition a reddish-brown breast, belly, and rump.
Then, too, the towhee arrives early, before larv&aelig; have
hatched; the oriole arrives in May, when swarms of insects
have begun their work of fertilizing blossoms of fruit
trees.</p>
<p>Professor Beal writes of the towhee as follows: &ldquo;After
snow has disappeared in early spring, an investigation of
the rustling so often heard among the leaves near a fence
or in a thicket will frequently disclose a towhee at work
scratching for his dinner after the manner of a hen; and
in these places and along the sunny border of woods, old
leaves will be found overturned where the bird has been
searching for hibernating beetles and larv&aelig;. The good
which the towhee does in this way can hardly be overestimated,
since the death of a single insect at this time, before
it has had an opportunity to deposit its egg, is equivalent
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
to the destruction of a host later in the year.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_91" href="#fn_91">[91]</a></p>
<p>While attending to business, this ground robin seems
most materialistic and worldly-minded; but when satisfied
with his quest for food, &ldquo;a change comes over the
spirit of his dreams.&rdquo; He perches upon a low bough;
in a sweet and joyous song he reveals his passionate devotion
to his mate, and brings pleasure to listeners whose
ears are attuned to the sounds of Nature.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTIONS AND BIOGRAPHIES
<br />OF
<br />OUR LATER SPRING BIRDS
<br />PART FOUR</h2>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<h2 id="c9">LATER SPRING BIRDS</h2>
<p>Spring comes with a rush in some parts of our
country and remains but a short time, so closely does
Summer follow in her footsteps. But in New England,
New York, northern Pennsylvania, Ohio, and neighboring
states, her approach is more gradual and restrained.</p>
<p>When maple and red-bud have laid aside their corals
and fruit-trees have donned their robes of white and shell-pink;
when the woods show again a flush of tender green,
Spring arrives. She has long been heralded by early
choristers; she is now accompanied by a host more wonderful
than retinue of kings, so varied is their dress and
so sweet their triumphal music. Grove and orchard are
alive with happy-hearted birds, who help to make May
the loveliest month of the year.</p>
<p>First come the swallows, skimming over pools and circling
above meadows&mdash;embodiment of grace, gladdening
the world with their joyous twitterings. Swifts, nighthawks,
and whip-poor-wills make nightfall vocal. Little
house wrens, each a fountain of bubbling music, take up
their abode near our homes.</p>
<p>Cuckoos slip quietly from tree to tree; thrashers and
catbirds seek thickets or perch on treetops, to sing like
their celebrated cousins, the mockingbirds. Shy ovenbirds
and lustrous-eyed thrushes return to live in the
woods, or pass through them as they journey to their northern
homes. The advent of the tanager in his flashing
scarlet, and the grosbeak with his glowing rose bring to
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
every bird-lover &ldquo;a most pointed pleasure.&rdquo; With Stevenson
he may say, [They] &ldquo;stab my spirit broad awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vireos and wood pewees appear in the groves; warblers
flit from treetop to treetop, many of them on their way to
northern woods. Orioles in the elms and orchards shout
with joy; bobolinks bubble and tinkle in the meadows;
indigo buntings and kingbirds greet us from roadsides,
and Maryland yellow-throats from thickets. Goldfinches
hold their May festival, and choose their mates as they
sing with joyous abandon. The earth is fresh and beautiful,
with promise of a glad fulfillment near at hand.</p>

<h2 id="c10">DESCRIPTIONS AND BIOGRAPHIES</h2>
<h2>THE TREE SWALLOW
<br /><i>Swallow Family&mdash;Hirundinid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 6 inches.</p>
<p><b>General Appearance</b>: Bluish-green above; pure white underneath,
from beak to tail; <i>tail not deeply forked</i>;
wings very long.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: Back, a dark, glistening green, giving this
swallow the name of &ldquo;The Green-backed Swallow&rdquo;;
the snowy white under parts give it the names of
&ldquo;White-breasted Swallow&rdquo; and &ldquo;White-bellied Swallow.&rdquo;
The green and white are about equally distributed;
the green on the head resembles a close-fitting
skull-cap, pulled down below the eyes.
Wings, <i>very long and powerful</i> (nearly 4&frac34;
inches), extending beyond the ends of the forked
tail. Bill short, <i>very wide at base</i>. Feet small and
weak&mdash;used only when resting, as swallows are generally
on the wing.</p>
<p><b>Young</b>: Brownish-gray, white beneath.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: A pleasant twitter.</p>
<p><b>Flight</b>: Swift, in great circles.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Tree swallows are seen along roadsides, and near
swamps and thickets. They formerly nested in dead
trees, in woodpeckers&rsquo; holes, or any available hollow.
They now take kindly to nesting-boxes. They have
&ldquo;roosts&rdquo; at night where they resort in great numbers,
especially on their way south in the late summer.
They have a great fondness for telegraph-wires.
During the fall migration, long chains of these swallows
are festooned on the wires during the daytime.
At night they disappear to their roosts, preferably
near marshes. They are a sight to be remembered
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
in the Jersey marshes, which Mr. Horsfall&rsquo;s accompanying
drawing depicts.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: North America from Alaska and northern Canada to
southern California, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, and
Virginia. They winter from central California,
southern Texas, southern parts of the Gulf States
and southeastern North Carolina, south over Mexico,
Guatemala, and Cuba; sometimes in New Jersey.
They eat bayberries that grow along the coast, and
thus are able to remain farther north in winter than
their relatives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First of the swallow host to speed northward is the
Tree Swallow, that migrates in April, as soon as a
sufficient number of insects have hatched to furnish a living
for these almost wholly insectivorous birds. Their
cheerful twitter and beautiful circling flight make them
very welcome.</p>
<p>Swallows have always been regarded with favor. They
were formerly considered a good omen, and were thought
to bring fair weather and prosperity. I shall always remember
the welcoming swallow that met our ship near the
Scilly Islands one June day, and preceded us without
resting for long hours as we voyaged close to the shore
of England. It seemed to presage the good fortune that
followed us.</p>
<p>Swallows fly with their broad beaks ready to open, and
catch unwary insects with great ease. They rise early
and continue their ceaseless quest for small beetles, flies,
mosquitoes, and other insects. Professor Beal says:
&ldquo;Most of these are either injurious or annoying, and the
numbers destroyed by swallows are not only beyond calculation
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
but almost beyond imagination.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_92" href="#fn_92">[92]</a> He pleads
for the protection of all swallows and suggests that the
&ldquo;white-bellied swallows&rdquo; be supplied with boxes similar
to those constructed for bluebirds, only placed at a greater
elevation and protected from cats.</p>
<p>Tree swallows are the first to come and first to go. Before
the summer has really arrived, as early as July first,
they begin to flock and form great colonies that may be
seen migrating during the daytime.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<h2>THE BARN SWALLOW
<br /><i>Swallow Family&mdash;Hirundinid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 7 inches; an inch longer than the tree swallow
because of longer tail; body nearly the same
size.</p>
<p><b>General Appearance</b>: <i>Upper parts a glossy bluish-black;
under parts reddish-brown and buff; tail deeply
forked.</i></p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Forehead and throat bright reddish-brown; breast, belly,
and feathers under wings a light brown, becoming
buffy; breast and throat separated by an indistinct
dark band; upper parts a shimmering bluish-black;
tail very deeply forked&mdash;the proverbial &ldquo;swallow-tail&rdquo;;
rounded white spots on the inner web of all
except the middle tail-feathers.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Resembles male, though paler in color; outer tail-feathers
a little shorter.</p>
<p><b>Young</b>: Backs duller, breasts paler, tail-feathers shorter than
those of adult male.</p>
<p><b>Notes</b>: A clear, sweet call, and a joyous, musical twitter&mdash;<i>weet-weet</i>,
or <i>twit-twit</i>.</p>
<p><b>Flight</b>: Long, sweeping curves that are beautiful to see. The
bird shows first his blue back, then his soft brown
breast. He flies nearer the ground than other swallows,
and surpasses them all in his power of flight.
Imagine the number of miles he travels in a day!</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Fields and farm-lands; also the vicinity of ponds
or other breeding-places of insects. The nest of
mud is usually fastened to a rafter of a barn. These
swallows often nest in colonies.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: North America, from northwestern Alaska and Canada,
to southern California and southwestern Texas,
northern Arkansas and North Carolina. They do
not breed in the southeastern part of the United
States. They winter in South America.</p>

<p class="caption">BARN SWALLOW</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>Most beautiful of all the swallows is this bluebird
fleet of the summer time. It is associated in
my mind with shining pools rimmed with iris; with fragrant
lilac-bushes, blossoming apple-trees, and waving
fields of grain near farm-buildings. Its sweet voice and
marvelous flight bring poetry into the prosaic life of the
farm.</p>
<p>Burroughs characterizes the swallow delightfully in
&ldquo;Under the Maples.&rdquo; He says: &ldquo;Is not the swallow one
of the oldest and dearest of birds? Known to the poets
and sages and prophets of all peoples! So infantile, so
helpless and awkward upon the earth, so graceful and
masterful on the wing, the child and darling of the summer
air, reaping its invisible harvest in the fields of space
as if it dined on sunbeams, touching no earthly food,
drinking and bathing and mating on the wing, swiftly,
tirelessly coursing the long day through, a thought on
wings, a lyric in the shape of a bird! Only in the free
fields of the summer air could it have got that steel-blue
of the wings and that warm tan of the breast. Of course
I refer to the barn swallow. The cliff swallow seems less
a child of the sky and sun, probably because its sheen
and glow are less, and its shape and motions less arrowy.
More varied in color, its hues yet lack the intensity, and
its flight the swiftness, of those of its brother of the hay-lofts.
The tree swallows and the bank swallows are pleasing,
but they are much more local and restricted in their
ranges than the barn-frequenters. As a farm boy I did
not know them at all, but the barn swallows the summer
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
always brought. After all, there is but one swallow; the
others are particular kinds that we specify.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_93" href="#fn_93">[93]</a></p>

<p class="caption">PURPLE MARTIN</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<h2>THE PURPLE MARTIN
<br /><i>Swallow Family&mdash;Hirundinid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 8 inches, the largest of the six common species
of swallow. Wings nearly 6 inches long&mdash;very
large when spread.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: <i>Glossy purplish-black head, body, and shoulders; wings
and tail duller. No reddish-brown or white. Tail
forked.</i></p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Bluish-black head and back; black wings and tail;
brownish-gray throat, neck, and sides, mottled with
white-tipped feathers; belly, grayish-white.</p>
<p><b>Young</b>: Similar to female.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: A sweet, rich, joyous warble. Mr. Forbush describes
it as &ldquo;a full-toned chirruping carol, musical and
clear, beginning <i>peuo-peuo-peuo</i>.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_94" href="#fn_94">[94]</a></p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Farm-lands and the vicinity of dwellings shaded by
trees. These birds were formerly more numerous
in the North than at present. They are more abundant
in the South than in the North.</p>
<p><b>Nests</b>: Made of twigs, grass, straw, or leaves, placed in gourds
or martin-houses. Martins are very social and
seem to revel in large &ldquo;bird-apartment-houses.&rdquo;
They formerly nested in hollow trees or caves.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: North and South America, except Pacific Coast region.
They breed in southern Canada, east of the Rockies;
in the United States from Montana and Idaho, south
to the Gulf Coast, Florida, and Mexico. They winter
in Brazil. A <span class="small">WESTERN MARTIN</span> is found on the
Pacific Coast.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Purple Martins have long been favorites. Mr.
Dutcher tells us that Indians, keen observers of
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
nature, realized that it was beneficial to have them near
their long-houses. They therefore hung hollowed gourds
to entice them. Southern negroes have done likewise.
They sometimes suspend a number of gourds from crossbars
surmounting a pole, to form nesting-sites for a small
colony.</p>
<p>Martins form an ideal community&mdash;busy, happy, harmonious&mdash;unless
English sparrows attempt to evict them
and appropriate their homes. Martin-houses and bluebird
nesting-boxes seem to be the envy of these pugnacious
sparrows. Martins attack crows and hawks but cannot
endure the persecutions of the English sparrow.</p>
<p>Martins are so useful that they should be protected
and encouraged whenever possible. A friend of mine
told me that she was never obliged to have her trees
sprayed while the martins remained. They feed on
wasps, bugs, and beetles, several varieties of which are
harmful, and they devour many flies and moths.</p>
<p>Dr. Dutcher quotes from Audubon regarding the flight
of martins as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The usual flight of this bird ... although graceful
and easy, cannot be compared in swiftness with that of
the Barn Swallow. Yet the martin is fully able to distance
any bird not of its own genus. They are very expert
at bathing and drinking while on the wing, when
over a large lake or river, giving a sudden motion to the
hind part of the body, as it comes in contact with the
water, thus dipping themselves in it, and then rising and
shaking their body, like a water spaniel, to throw off the
water.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_95" href="#fn_95">[95]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<h2>THE CLIFF OR EAVE SWALLOW
<br /><i>Swallow Family&mdash;Hirundinid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 6 inches; one inch smaller than the barn swallow,
and two inches smaller than the martin.</p>
<p><b>General Appearance</b>: A multi-colored swallow&mdash;a sort of
combination of barn swallow and martin, with areas
and patches of dark blue, chestnut, gray, and white,
and <i>bright reddish-brown upper tail-coverts</i>, that differentiate
it from the other swallows.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: Forehead creamy white, head bluish-black;
throat and cheeks reddish-brown; a brownish ring
about the neck shading to gray; back bluish-black
streaked with white; breast gray with a wash of
brown, and a blue-black patch where the throat joins
the breast; wings and tail brownish; tail only slightly
forked.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: A harsher, less musical note than that of the barn swallow
and martin.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Meadows and marshes. These swallows formerly
nested in cliffs; now they build under eaves of buildings.</p>
<p><b>Nests</b>: Curiously shaped pouches of mud that make one think
of protuberant knot-holes, or of flasks made of skin.
The nests vary with the shape of the places to which
they are fastened. Eave swallows also nest in colonies.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: North America. Breed from central Alaska and north-central
Canada over nearly all the United States except
Florida and the Rio Grande Valley. They
probably winter in Brazil and Argentina.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Forbush writes about the Cliff or Eave Swallow
as follows:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;When the first explorers reached the Yellowstone and
other western rivers, swallows were found breeding on
the precipitous banks. As settlers gradually worked
their way westward, the swallows found nesting-places
under the eaves of their rough buildings. In these new
breeding-places they were better protected from the elements
and their enemies than on their native cliffs and
so the Cliff Swallow became the Eave Swallow, and, following
the settlements, rapidly increased in numbers and
worked eastward.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_96" href="#fn_96">[96]</a> These swallows were very numerous
fifty years ago. It is now generally conceded that
English sparrows are largely responsible for their decrease.
It is greatly to be deplored, for swallows add
much to the charm of out-door life, and subtract many
annoyances in the form of insect pests, especially flies
and mosquitoes.</p>
<h2>THE BANK SWALLOW
<br /><i>Swallow Family&mdash;Hirundinid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: A little over 5 inches; the smallest of the six common
swallows.</p>
<p><b>General Appearance</b>: <i>Brownish-gray above; band of same
color across breast</i>; throat and under parts white.
The gray head and white throat form a cap similar
in effect to that of the tree swallow.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: A twitter, less pleasing than that of the martin and the
barn swallow.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Sandy banks of rivers, and shores of lakes.</p>
<p><b>Nests</b>: In holes made in sand-banks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p><b>Range</b>: North and South America. Breeds from the tree-regions
of Alaska and Canada to southern California,
Arizona, Texas, Louisiana, and Virginia. It migrates
through Mexico and Central America and
probably winters in northern South America to
Brazil and Peru.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <span class="small">ROUGH-WINGED SWALLOW</span> resembles the bank
swallow so closely that it is difficult to distinguish
them, unless one can see the darker breast and throat of
the rough-wing and the <i>absence of a dark band across the
breast</i>. Upon careful examination of the latter species,
each long outer wing-feather is discovered to have a rough
saw-tooth edge.</p>
<p>The habits of the birds are similar, though the rough-wings,
like ph&oelig;bes, nest not only in banks, but against
stone walls and stone bridges. They have a more restricted
range than barn swallows. They breed from
southern Canada to northern Florida and southern California,
and winter in Mexico and Central America.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<h2>THE CHIMNEY SWIFT
<br /><i>Swift Family&mdash;Micropodid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 5&frac12; inches; wings nearly 5 inches long.</p>
<p><b>General Appearance</b>: In the sky, the swift looks unlike any
other bird. The wings are long and flap like those
of a mechanical toy-bird. The tail appears <i>rounded</i>,
not <i>forked</i>, like those of swallows.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: Brownish-gray, lighter gray on throat; a
black spot before each eye; wings longer than tail;
tail short, with ribs of the feathers extending beyond
the vanes, giving the effect of sharp needle- or pin-points.
The bird has a <i>sooty</i> appearance.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: A noisy, incessant twitter.</p>
<p><b>Flight</b>: Rapid, and seemingly erratic and aimless. Swifts&rsquo;
wings appear to beat the air alternately. The birds
move in great curves, seldom alight, and drop suddenly
into chimneys at night or when they wish to
enter their nests.</p>
<p><b>Nest</b>: A wall-pocket, built of sticks glued together and to the
wall by a sticky saliva secreted by the swifts. During
rainy weather the nest is sometimes loosened, and
falls.</p>
<p><b>Eggs</b>: White, like those of woodpeckers and some others laid
in dark places.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: As swifts secure all of their food while on the wing
and seldom alight, they have no habitat except the
atmosphere and the hollow trees or chimneys in
which they congregate at night, and where they nest.
They do not perch on telegraph wires as swallows
like to do.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Breed in eastern North America, from southcentral
Canada to the Gulf, and westward to the Plains;
winter south of the United States.</p>

<p class="caption">CHIMNEY SWIFT</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>Swifts have often been called &ldquo;Chimney Swallows,&rdquo;
but the name is a misnomer; they belong to an entirely
different family. The breadth of wing and rapid
flight, the weak feet and broad bills are, however, points
of resemblance; the sooty appearance and lack of beautiful
luster of plumage are points of difference. Then, too,
swifts&rsquo; tails are less like swallows&rsquo; tails than they are like
those of woodpeckers and creepers; the spiny tips are used
as props against a perpendicular surface.</p>
<p>The following facts concerning swifts are taken from
Eaton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Birds of New York&rdquo;:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly every village or city [in New York State] can
boast at least one large chimney or church or schoolhouse
that harbors multitudes of swifts every night late in summer.
It is an interesting sight to watch these swifts as
they wheel about such a chimney in the August and September
evenings and, when the magic moment arrives,
pour down its capacious mouth in a living cascade. It
seems impossible for this species to perch, but it always
alights on some perpendicular surface like the inside of
a large hollow tree or the inner surface of a chimney or
the perpendicular boards at the gable end of a barn or
shed. In this position it sleeps, clinging with its sharp
claws to the irregular surface and using its spiny tail as a
support. The swift is seen abroad early in the morning
and late in the afternoon, but in cloudy weather comes out
at any time of day and evidently can see well in the bright
sunlight, for it frequently hunts material for its nest during
the brightest weather. They begin to construct the nest
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
in May or early June, the small twigs of which it is formed
being broken from dead branches of some shade tree by
the bird flying directly against the tip of the twig and snapping
it off. The twigs are carried into the chimney and
are cemented to the wall and to each other by a gelatinous
substance secreted by the salivary glands of the bird itself.
When completed, the nest is like a little semi-circular
bracket slightly hollowed downward. The eggs are placed
on this framework of twigs without lining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In food the swift is wholly insectivorous, and does an
immense amount of good destroying beetles, flies, and
gnats, which he devours in countless multitudes. The
chimney swift, as he darts by, frequently utters a rapid
chipper something like the syllable <i>chip, chip, chip</i>, rapidly
repeated, and I have heard a loud cheeping in the
chimney, evidently uttered by the young birds. One of the
earliest impressions of my boyhood was the curious roaring
caused by the wings of parent swifts as they came and
went from their nests at daybreak. This unfortunate
habit of early rising has brought the chimney swift into
bad repute in many civilized communities, ... closing
chimneys against this beneficial bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Major Charles Bendire&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life Histories of American
Birds&rdquo; occur the following statements from Mr. Otto
Widman regarding the nests and young of chimney swifts:
&ldquo;The setting parent shields the structure by habitually
covering its base with the breast and pressing its head
against the wall above. When disturbed, it hides below
the nest, as do the young birds. They make a hissing noise,
and always remain 2 or 3 feet below the mouth of the
chimney [shaft], where they are fed by the parents until
they are four weeks old.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;Few birds are more devoted to their young than the
Chimney Swift, and instances are recorded where the parent
was seen to enter chimneys in burning houses, even
after the entire roof was a mass of flames, preferring to
perish with its offspring rather than to forsake them.&rdquo;</p>

white tips to outer tail-feathers.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: <i>Whip&prime;-poor-will, whip&prime;-poor-will, whip&prime;-poor-will</i>, uttered
rapidly, monotonously, lugubriously, continuously.
My sister counted 275 repetitions of his note
given without a pause. To some people the sound
is unendurable. When near the bird, I have heard
him give a soft <i>chuck</i> between the repetition of the
word <i>whip-poor-will</i>. He is associated in my mind
with bright moonlight evenings, for it is then he is
most vociferous. He sings, also, early in the morning.</p>
<p><b>Flight</b>: Swift, yet noiseless; almost as uncanny as his note.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: In woods and open groves, where one may come
upon him both at night and during the daytime sitting
lengthwise on a log or branch instead of crosswise.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p><b>Nest</b>: No nest is made, but two dull-colored, mottled eggs are
laid on the ground or on dead leaves.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern North America. Breeds from southern Canada
to the northern parts of Louisiana, Mississippi,
and Georgia, and from the Plains eastward; winters
from eastern South Carolina and the southern Gulf
States to Central America. The <span class="small">CHUCK-WILL&rsquo;S-WIDOW</span>
is a resident of our southeastern states; the <span class="small">POOR-WILL</span>
of our western states.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whip-poor-will is too interesting and useful a bird
to be disregarded. He has been widely disliked and
even superstitiously dreaded because of his weird notes.
He is, however, of especial interest to scientists because of
his nocturnal habits and his value as a destroyer of insects.
Mr. Forbush calls him &ldquo;an animated insect trap,&rdquo;
with an &ldquo;enormous mouth surrounded by long bristles
which form a wide fringe about the yawning cavity.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_97" href="#fn_97">[97]</a>
The whip-poor-will is believed to be the greatest enemy of
night-moths; he eats other insects, also, in great quantities.</p>
<p>The chuck-will&rsquo;s-widow is even more interesting than
the whip-poor-will. Mr. W. L. McAtee writes of the
bird as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like other species of its family, it lays only two eggs,
which may be deposited almost anywhere on the forest
floor, there being no nest. Intrusion on this spot usually
results in the bird moving the eggs, which it carries in its
mouth. Although the bird is only 12 inches long, the
mouth fully extended forms an opening at least 2 by 3&frac12;
inches in size. It is but natural, therefore, that the bird
should prey upon some of the largest insects. Not only
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
are large insects captured and swallowed, but even small
birds, in two cases warblers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Despite the fact that the chuck-will&rsquo;s-widow occasionally
devours small insectivorous birds, it must be reckoned
a useful species. It is probable that birds are not deliberately
sought, but that they are taken instinctively,
as would be a moth or other large insect coming within
reach of that capacious mouth.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_98" href="#fn_98">[98]</a></p>

<h2>THE NIGHTHAWK
<br /><i>Goatsucker Family&mdash;Caprimulgid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: 10 inches; wings 7&frac34; inches.</p>
<p><b>General Appearance</b>: A large dark bird, with a <i>white throat</i>,
<i>a white band across the tail</i>, and <i>very long wings</i>,
on each of which is a <i>large white spot or bull&rsquo;s-eye</i>,
unfortunately a target, like the white rump of the
flicker.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Black above, mottled with buff and white; under parts
lighter (becoming whitish), barred with black;
throat with a tent-shaped white patch below the <i>very
wide</i> bill; upper breast black; tail notched, a white
band extending across it near the end except on the
middle tail-feathers; wing with a conspicuous area
of white about half-way between the curve and tip,
when outspread.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Throat buff; under parts buffy; no white on the tail.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: A loud <i>peeng-peeng</i>; uttered at frequent intervals while
on the wing.</p>
<p><b>Flight</b>: Very swift, with numerous and rapid changes of direction.
The bird is very active at nightfall. It
makes rapid descents not unlike those made by an
airplane; it has a habit of dropping &ldquo;like a bolt
from the blue.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: The nighthawk is a &ldquo;bird of the air&rdquo; rather than of
treetops or ground. It may be seen in cities flying
above houses in search of its insect prey at sunset
and during the night.</p>
<p><b>Nest</b>: No nest, but two speckled eggs are laid on the ground
or on a roof where they are not easily discovered.
Mr. Forbush says, &ldquo;The nighthawk has deposited its
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
eggs on gravel roofs in cities for at least forty years
and probably longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Young</b>: Dr. F. H. Herrick tells us that the nestlings are
&ldquo;clothed in down&rdquo; and &ldquo;look like two little flattened
balls of fluffy worsted of a dark cream-color mottled
with brown.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern and central North America. Breeds from
Manitoba, southern Quebec, New Brunswick, and
Nova Scotia south to northern Louisiana, Mississippi,
and Georgia, and from eastern North Dakota, Nebraska,
and Kansas eastward; winters from the lowlands
of South Carolina and southern parts of the
Gulf States to British Honduras and Salvador.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nighthawk is a remarkable bird. Because of
its nocturnal habits, it has been regarded with
superstitious awe. Erroneous ideas of it have been entertained,
and it has received a name that belies it. It
is not a <i>hawk</i> at all; it preys only on insects, not on
chickens or small rodents.</p>
<p>Mr. W. L. McAtee writes: &ldquo;Nighthawks are so expert
in flight that no insects can escape them. They sweep up
in their capacious mouths everything from the largest
moths and dragon flies to the tiniest ants and gnats, and
in this way sometimes gather most remarkable collections
of insects. Several stomachs have contained fifty
or more different kinds, and the numbers of individuals
may run into the thousands. Nearly a fourth of the
bird&rsquo;s total food consists of ants.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_99" href="#fn_99">[99]</a> Professor Beal estimated
that the stomachs of eighty-seven nighthawks which
he examined &ldquo;contained not less than twenty thousand
ants, and these were not half of the insect contents.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_100" href="#fn_100">[100]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
Mr. Forbush claims that the nighthawk &ldquo;ranks next to the
flicker in the destruction of ants, and it takes them when
they are flying and about to propagate.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_101" href="#fn_101">[101]</a></p>
<p>It has a fondness for fireflies, also. Dr. Herrick made
careful observation of the habits of nighthawks, and the
manner of feeding their young. He writes of seeing a
mother-bird &ldquo;loaded with fireflies.&rdquo; He says: &ldquo;As her
great mouth opened you beheld wide jaws and throat
brilliantly illuminated like a spacious apartment all aglow
with electricity. She made an electrical display at every
utterance of her harsh <i>ke-ark</i>. Then standing over her
young, with raised and quivering wings, she put her bill
down into his throat and pumped him full. She then
tucked the little one under her breast and began to brood.
She repeated the performance, after which she settled
down to brood as if for the night. This young bird
was fed but twice each evening between the hours of
eight and nine o&rsquo;clock, and always, as I believe, by the
female. It is quite probable that another feeding occurs
also at dawn. The male would sometimes swoop down
and once he sat by the chick for ten minutes after dusk.
The task of feeding was borne by the mother.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_102" href="#fn_102">[102]</a></p>

<h2>THE HOUSE WREN
<br /><i>Wren Family&mdash;Troglodytid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 4&frac34; inches.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: Cinnamon-brown above, reddish-brown on
the rump and tail. Back with fine indistinct bars;
wings and tail with heavier bars; under parts grayish-white
washed with brown, lighter on throat and
breast; sides, and feathers under tail, barred with
black; tail frequently held upright.</p>
<p><b>Notes</b>: Sharp scolding notes.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A sweet bubbling song. The notes are poured forth
with joyous abandon and tireless energy.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Near the homes of man preferably, though in the
winter many house wrens are found in southern
woods. They dart in and out of wood-piles and
brush-heaps, run along walls and fences, and seek
shrubbery, vines, and orchards.</p>
<p><b>Nest</b>: Of small sticks, lined with root-fibers or grasses, placed
in a hollow of a tree, in a nesting-box, or some out-of-the-way
place, such as a flower-pot, tin-can, discarded
shoe, old hat, etc.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern North America. Breeds from southeastern
Canada, eastern Wisconsin and Michigan, southward
to Kentucky and Virginia; winters in eastern Texas,
and in the South Atlantic and Gulf States.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Little &ldquo;Jenny Wren&rdquo; figured in our nursery tales
and was one of the delights of our childhood, because
of its diminutive size, its pert, cocked tail, its incessant
activity, and its continuous chatter. No dull moments
when a wren was near by!</p>
<p>Its nesting-habits make it interesting to young and old.
Though loyal to a nesting-locality, it will make its neat
nest in a great variety of places, such as boxes, empty
jars, small pails, or gourds, if placed conveniently, or
in wren-houses.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig37">

<p class="caption">HOUSE WREN</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>Wrens are valiant defenders of their nests, but have
been driven away from favorite nesting-places by quarrelsome
English sparrows; consequently wrens are decreasing
in number. Wren-houses with openings about an inch in
diameter, too small for sparrows to enter, may help
somewhat to check the decrease of these valuable insect-eating
birds.</p>
<p>They are noisy little neighbors, a curious combination
of joyousness and irritability. A pair of wrens that
built a nest on the piazza of my brother&rsquo;s home spent so
much time in scolding and quarreling that they were almost
unendurable. One morning they disappeared; a
few hours later my brother found the drowned body of
the female in a rain-barrel. Whether it was accident,
murder, or suicide, no one knew, but within twenty-four
hours a pleasanter-tempered Lady Wren appeared, swept
and garnished the home of her predecessor, and set up
house-keeping. A larger measure of peace reigned thereafter.</p>
<p>As songsters, wrens are very remarkable for volume of
sound, for sweetness of tone, and for extreme ecstasy. I
remember wakening about sunrise one morning in early
June, when the spring chorus was at its climax. For
about an hour, I had the joy of listening to a bird-concert
more wonderful than any I had ever heard. After a
time I distinguished the voices of the various familiar
birds. Loudest, clearest, and sweetest of all rang the voice
of the smallest member of the choir&mdash;that of the tiny
house wren.</p>

<h2>THE RUBY-THROATED HUMMINGBIRD
<br /><i>Hummingbird Family&mdash;Trochilid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 3&frac34; inches; bill over &frac12; inch.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Iridescent green above; gray below, with a glint of
green, especially on the sides; wings and tail brown,
with slight iridescence; throat brilliant ruby,&mdash;brownish
in some lights; <i>tail forked</i>.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Similar to male, but <i>without ruby on throat</i>, which
is flecked with minute brownish spots; <i>tail-feathers
of nearly even length</i>, outer feathers with white tips.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: No song&mdash;only a faint squeak.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Open country; cultivated tracts of land, especially
those overrun with vines; gardens, particularly those
that contain trumpet-creepers and honey-suckles.</p>
<p><b>Nest</b>: One of the most exquisite nests made. It is in the
shape of a tiny cup, covered with lichens and lined
with soft materials. It is frequently placed so high
on a branch as to be difficult to distinguish from an
excrescence on the bough. The eggs look like white
beans.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern North America. Breeds from central Canada
to the Gulf Coast and Florida; winters from central
Florida and Louisiana through Southern Mexico and
Central America to Panama.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hummingbirds are rightly in a family by themselves&mdash;they
are unique. They are the smallest
of our birds, and yet they possess a power of flight unsurpassed.
Mr. Forbush says: &ldquo;The little body, divested
of its feathers, is no larger than the end of one&rsquo;s finger,
but the breast muscles which move the wings are enormous
in proportion to the size of the bird. They form
a large part of the entire trunk, and their power is such
that they can vibrate the inch-long feathers of those little
wings with such rapidity that the human eye can scarcely
follow the bird when it is moved to rapid flight by fear
or passion.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_103" href="#fn_103">[103]</a></p>
<div class="img" id="fig38">

<p class="caption">RUBY-THROATED HUMMING-BIRD</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>The wings do not seem to be made of feathers, but of
gauze, like those of insects. I never really saw the
feathers until I held a dead hummingbird in my hand.
Its iridescent body seems made of burnished metal.</p>
<p>It is wonderful that so tiny a creature can wing its way
from Central America to the heart of Canada. It seems
to know no fear; it is quite able to defend itself with its
long sharp bill. Mr. Forbush says: &ldquo;The males fight
with one another, and, secure in their unequalled powers
of flight, they attack other and larger birds. When the
Hummingbird says &lsquo;Go!&rsquo; other birds stand not upon the
order of their going, but go at once; while the little warrior
sometimes accelerates their flight, for his sharp beak is a
weapon not to be despised. Even the Kingbird goes when
the war-like Hummer comes; the English Sparrow flees
in terror; only the Woodpeckers stand their ground.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fn_103">[103]</a></p>
<p>Hummingbirds are not only fearless and pugnacious,
but they are very inquisitive. Major Bendire says: &ldquo;I
once occupied quarters that were completely covered with
trumpet-vines, and when these were in bloom the place
fairly swarmed with Ruby-throats. They were exceedingly
inquisitive, and often poised themselves before an
open window and looked in my rooms, full of curiosity,
their bright little eyes sparkling like black beads. I
caught several&mdash;by simply putting my hand over them,
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
and while so imprisoned they never moved, and feigned
death, but as soon as I opened my hand they were off like
a flash. They seem to be especially partial to anything
red.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_104" href="#fn_104">[104]</a></p>
<p>Their fondness for honey-producing flowers has caused
many people to believe that they live upon nectar and
ambrosia, like the gods of the Greeks, but the Biological
Survey, has, by close observation, discovered that they do
not visit flowers wholly for the purpose of gathering honey,
but for obtaining also small insects that have been
drowned in a welter of sweetness. Professor Beal has
observed them &ldquo;hovering in front of a cobweb, picking
off insects and perhaps spiders entangled in the net.
They have also been observed to capture their food on the
wing, like flycatchers. Stomach examination shows that
a considerable portion of their food consists of insects and
spiders.&rdquo; Professor Beal continues: &ldquo;Although hummingbirds
are the smallest of the avian race, their
stomachs are much smaller in proportion to their bodies
than those of other birds, while their livers are much
larger. This would indicate that these birds live to a considerable
extent upon concentrated sweets, as stated above,
and that the insects, spiders, etc., found in the stomachs
do not represent by any means all their food.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_105" href="#fn_105">[105]</a></p>
<p>A physician of my acquaintance owns a camp in the
New Hampshire woods. A birch near his house was attacked
by sapsuckers. Sap exuded plentifully and was
eagerly sought by two red squirrels, a small swarm of
bees, two sapsuckers, and seven hummingbirds. With his
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">195</span>
glasses, the doctor observed the birds eating insects served
in birch syrup.</p>
<p>Professor Beal reports having seen as many as one hundred
hummingbirds &ldquo;hovering about the flowers of a
buckeye tree, and this number was maintained all day and
for many days, though the individuals were going and
coming all the time.&rdquo; Burroughs once saw a hummingbird
take his morning bath in dewdrops.</p>
<p>There are about five hundred known species of hummingbird.
They may be found in North and South
America from Alaska to Patagonia. They are most
numerous in northern South America, in Colombia and
Ecuador. Seventeen species are found in our western
and southwestern states, but only one, the Ruby-throat,
lives in the East.</p>

<p>The Indigo Bunting possesses a brilliant beauty and
a sweet voice. A sight of him and his pretty
brown mate brings a thrill of pleasure, but he holds no
such place in our affections as does the true bluebird.
He does not choose to nest close to human dwellings, but
prefers overgrown pastures, not too much frequented,
where he performs his good office of caterpillar-, canker
worm-, and grasshopper-hunting, varying his diet with an
abundance of weed seeds.</p>

<p>The indigo-bird, the scarlet tanager, the goldfinch, and
the Baltimore oriole are our most brilliant summer birds.
Thoreau, in his &ldquo;Notes on New England Birds&rdquo; makes
the following comment:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a splendid and marked bird, high-colored as
is the tanager, looking strange in this latitude. Glowing
indigo. It flits from the top of one bush to another,
chirping as if anxious. Wilson says it sings, not like
most other birds in the morning and evening chiefly, but
also in the middle of the day. In this I notice it is like
the tanager, the other fiery-plumaged bird. They seem
to love the heat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During August, the songs of the indigo-bird and red-eyed
vireo may be heard along wooded roadsides, and
are especially welcome because most birds are silent at
that time.</p>

<h2>THE BALTIMORE ORIOLE
<br /><i>American-Blackbird Family&mdash;Icterid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 7&frac12; inches.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Head, throat, neck, and upper half of back black;
breast, belly, shoulders, lower half of back and outer
tail-feathers <i>brilliant orange</i>; wings black, many
feathers edged with white; half of middle tail-feathers
black; others largely orange; bill long,
slender, sharp.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Upper parts grayish-olive, washed with yellow and
mottled with black on head and back; under parts,
tail, and rump dull orange, paler at throat, which
is sometimes marked with black; wings brown, barred
with white.</p>
<p><b>Notes</b>: A loud <i>whew-y</i>, or <i>whew</i>, uttered frequently and insistently,
with a falling inflection. Orioles chatter
noisily, also.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A rich, melodious strain, very different in individuals,
but alike in a liquid quality, and in frequency of
utterance. For several successive years, two orioles
returned to our elms and apple-trees in Cleveland.
Their songs differed as decidedly from each other

<p class="caption">BALTIMORE ORIOLE</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>Orioles, with their brilliant plumage and beautiful
song, belong to the somber-hued, unmusical
blackbird family. They are truly &ldquo;the flower of the
flock,&rdquo;&mdash;gorgeous tropical flowers, too. They invariably
arouse interest and almost always great admiration. So
dashing are they that they do not remain long enough near
us to let us know them well or love them. They remind
me of brilliant opera-singers, elegantly attired, who are
followed by the eager eyes of a host of people.</p>
<p>So many poets and writers of prose have sung the praise
of orioles that it surprised me to learn that neither Thoreau
nor Burroughs admired them. Thoreau wrote: &ldquo;Two
gold robins; they chatter like blackbirds; the fire bursts
forth on their backs when they lift their wings.... But
the note is not melodious and rich. It is at most a clear
tone.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_106" href="#fn_106">[106]</a> Burroughs said: &ldquo;I have no use for the oriole.
He has not one musical note, and in grape time his bill
is red, or purple, with the blood of our grapes.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_107" href="#fn_107">[107]</a></p>
<p>A grape-eating propensity is not a trait common to
orioles, according to Professor Beal&rsquo;s report of their food
habits. He says: &ldquo;Brilliancy of plumage, sweetness of
song, and food habits to which no exception can be taken
are characteristics of the Baltimore oriole. During the
stay of the oriole in the United States, vegetable matter
amounts to only a little more than 16 per cent. of its food,
so that the possibility of its doing much damage to crops
is very limited. The bird is accused of eating peas to a
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
considerable extent, but remains of such were found in
only two cases. One writer says that it damages grapes,
but none were found in the stomachs.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_108" href="#fn_108">[108]</a> Professor Beal
lists caterpillars, beetles, bugs, ants, wasps, grasshoppers,
and some spiders as the &ldquo;fare of the oriole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nest and nesting habits of these birds are unusually
interesting. In Eaton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Birds of New York&rdquo; occurs the
following description:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The female is an ideal mother, defending her young
with great courage and caring for them in all kinds of
weather. The young, however, are not such ideal offspring
as she ought to expect. From the time they begin
to feather out until several days after they have left the
nest, they keep up a continual cry for food. In this way
they are unquestionably located by many predaceous animals
and thereby destroyed. The young orioles are usually
out of the nest from the 20th of June to the 5th of
July [in New York State], and are very soon led away
by the old birds into the woods, groves, and dense hedgerows.
Then we hear no more of the oriole&rsquo;s song until
the latter days of August or the first week in September,
when, after the autumn molt has been completed, the
males frequently burst into melody for a few days before
departing for their winter home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As every one knows, the oriole builds a pensile nest,
usually suspending it from the drooping branches of an
elm tree, soft maple, apple tree, or in fact, any tree, though
his preference seems to be for the elm. The main construction
materials used by the oriole are gray plant-fibers,
especially those from the outside of milkweed stalks,
waste packing-cord and horsehair; sometimes pieces of
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
rags and paper are discovered in the nest, but it is almost
without exception a grayish bag as it appears from the
outside, and is lined principally with horsehairs and softer
materials, making a thick felted gourd-shaped structure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One morning this past May when the heat was unseasonable
and overpowering, an oriole was observed fluttering
anxiously near the nest where his mate sat on her eggs.
The foliage had not developed sufficiently to shade her,
so he alighted on the nest, a claw on either side of the
cup-like opening. There he stood astride for the greater

<h2>THE ORCHARD ORIOLE
<br /><i>American Blackbird Family&mdash;Icterid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 7 inches.</p>
<p><b>Adult Male</b>: <b>Breeding Plumage</b>: Head, throat, neck, and upper half of back black;
breast, belly, shoulders, lower half of back a bright
chestnut brown; wings and tail dark brown; wing-feathers
tipped or edged with white, forming a bar
across wing. The winter plumage is different from
the breeding plumage; the male passes through several
changes as he matures.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Olive-green above, darkest on head and back, dull
yellow below; wing-feathers tipped with white, forming
two bars across wing; tail olive-green.</p>
<p><b>Immature Male</b>: Like female, the first autumn; the next
spring, he has a black throat; the chestnut plumage
develops later.</p>
<p><b>Notes and Song</b>: Similar to those of the Baltimore oriole.
Song clear and melodious; tones possibly not quite
so <i>mellow</i> as those of its relatives, but sweeter.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Orchards and shade trees.</p>
<p><b>Nest</b>: A pensile nest, but shorter and more firmly attached
than that of the Baltimore oriole.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern North America. Breeds from northern United
States, southern Canada, and central New York,
south to northern Florida and the Gulf Coast, west
to Texas, central Nebraska, and western Kansas;
winters from southern Mexico to northern Colombia.
Not common in Massachusetts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The markings of the Orchard Oriole are similar to
those of the more brilliant and striking Baltimore
Oriole, but its coloring more nearly resembles that of the
towhee. Like its cousin, it is arboreal, while the towhee
is a ground bird.</p>

<p>The orchard oriole is more shy than the Baltimore
oriole and is less well known. It is, however, very active
and restless,&mdash;indefatigable in its quest for insects. It
has a better reputation than most members of the blackbird
family. Major Bendire says that it would be difficult
to find a bird that does more good and less harm
than the orchard oriole, and that it should be fully protected.</p>

<h2>THE SCARLET TANAGER
<br /><i>Tanager Family&mdash;Tangarid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 7 inches.</p>
<p><b>General Appearance</b>: <i>A bright scarlet body, with black wings
and tail; no crest.</i></p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Scarlet and black in breeding plumage; after the molt,
<i>olive</i> and <i>yellow, with black wings</i> and <i>tail</i>; wings
white underneath. The male does not acquire red
plumage until the second year. While molting, the
adult male has irregular patches of olive and yellow
mixed with his red feathers, giving a curious effect.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Olive-green above; yellowish-olive below, brightest
on throat; wings and tail dark gray, washed with
olive. She is very effectively protected by her coloring.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Call-note <i>chip-chur</i>, very distinct and reasonably loud.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A warble, full, rich, and pleasing, but not varied; sufficiently
like the songs of the robin and the rose-breasted
grosbeak to make identification difficult for a
beginner. The frequent <i>chip-chur</i> betrays the
tanager&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Dense groves of hard-wood trees, especially those
containing oaks. Mr. Forbush calls the tanager
&ldquo;the appointed guardian of the oaks.&rdquo; The bird
is found in parks and on well-wooded estates, as
well as in the deep woods.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern North America and northern South America.
Breeds in southern Canada as far west as the Plains,
and in the United States to southern Kansas, northern
Arkansas, Tennessee, northern Georgia, and the
mountains of Virginia and South Carolina; winters
from Colombia to Bolivia and Peru.</p>

<p>These &ldquo;black-winged redbirds&rdquo; are occasionally mistaken
by novices for cardinals, but the dusky wings
and tail, and the absence of a crest differentiate them.
Then, too, the scarlet of their coats is of a different shade
of red.</p>
<p>Their cousins, the <span class="small">SUMMER TANAGERS</span>, denizens of
southeastern United States and occasional residents of
the North, resemble cardinals more closely. Both have
a nearly uniform rose-red plumage, but the summer
tanager has brownish wings edged with red, and <i>no crest</i>.</p>
<p>The beauty of male tanagers has caused them to be
eagerly sought in the past. I have childish memories of
their scarlet bodies decorating the hats of thoughtless
women, and I blush to confess a feeling of envy rather
than regret at the wicked slaughter. Audubon Societies
have done much to change public sentiment and put a
stop to barbarous practices.</p>
<p>Never shall I forget the breathless joy I felt when,
grown to young womanhood, I first saw a tanager&rsquo;s vivid
beauty gleaming against the almost black-green foliage
of a dense grove. I think that I remember every tanager
which I have since seen, as well as each lovely setting that
enhanced his gorgeous coloring. A glimpse of one marks
a red-letter day. Twice I have seen two males at once,
in company with a rose-breasted grosbeak&mdash;all singing;
memorable experiences.</p>
<p>The <span class="small">WESTERN TANAGER</span>, with his yellow body and
crown, his red &ldquo;face,&rdquo; black back and tail, and yellow
and black wings, appeared before me one day in the noble
woods that crown Glacier Point in the Yosemite Valley.
I felt that his beauty, like that of his eastern relatives, was
his &ldquo;excuse for being.&rdquo; He does not enjoy quite so good
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
a reputation as do other tanagers, because he has a taste
for fruit&mdash;almost as reprehensible as horse- or cattle-stealing
in the west.</p>
<p>Tanagers, however, are valuable insect-destroyers.
Our brilliant species deserves our whole-hearted protection,
not only for aesthetic, but also for economic reasons.</p>

<h2>THE ROSE-BREASTED GROSBEAK
<br /><i>Finch Family&mdash;Fringillid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: A little over 8 inches.</p>
<p><b>General Appearance</b>: A black and white bird, with a <i>rose-colored
breast</i> and <i>heavy, flesh-colored beak</i>.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Head, throat, and back black; rump and under parts
white, except <i>on breast</i> and <i>under wings</i>, which are
a beautiful <i>rose-red</i>; wings black, with bars and
patches of white; tail black; outer feathers with
white tips to their inner webs. The winter plumage
is slightly different from the summer plumage.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: A soft grayish-brown, streaked with white, buff, and
gray; under parts light buff, faintly streaked with
brown; head brown; a buff streak through center of
the crown, a white streak over the eye; wings and
tail grayish-brown, some of the wing-feathers tipped
with white; yellow under wings instead of rose.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: A sharp <i>tsick, tsick</i>.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A rich, beautiful warble, somewhat like that of the
robin and tanager, but more joyous than either. It
possesses a purer, more liquid quality. The song
is remarkable, also, in that it may be heard at night,
and at midday.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Woodlands and thickets, fields and gardens. This
grosbeak frequents also the shade trees of large estates
and suburban streets.</p>
<p><b>Nest</b>: Large and loosely constructed, made of twigs, grasses,
and root-fibers, and placed from five to twenty feet
from the ground.</p>
<p><b>Eggs</b>: Pale blue, spotted with brown or purple. The male
takes his turn at sitting on the eggs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern North America and northern South America.
Breeds from southern Canada south to Kansas, Missouri,
Ohio, New Jersey, and in the mountains of
northern Georgia; winters from southern Mexico to
Colombia and Ecuador.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So beautiful is the rose-breasted grosbeak and so melodious
his song that he invariably attracts attention.
Upon close acquaintance, he reveals many interesting
habits and delightful traits. He is so useful that he reminds
one of the occasional rare person who combines
practical qualities with beauty of form and face and unusual
gifts.</p>
<p>He is one of our most beneficial birds. Occasionally
he partakes of cultivated fruit and devours green peas,
but the slight mischief he is guilty of is greatly overbalanced
by the good he does. So fond is he of the Colorado
potato beetle that in some localities he is called the
&ldquo;potato-bug bird.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_109" href="#fn_109">[109]</a> Professor Beal tells of watching
grosbeaks near a potato-patch that was nearly riddled by
these destructive insects. He saw the parent-birds visit
the field repeatedly, and then bring their young when
able to fly. The brood perched in a row on the top rail
of the fence, and were fed so frequently that in a few
days the potato-bugs had entirely disappeared. The crop
was saved.</p>
<p>Grosbeaks appear to lead unusually happy domestic
lives. Though the males fight for their mates, they guard
them and their young with great devotion. They not only
utter low sweet notes to the mother-bird as she broods, but
quite frequently take her place on the nest.</p>
<p>My sister tells of hearing a rose-breast&rsquo;s song in a maple
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">209</span>
grove, and of searching diligently for the singer. She located
the tree from which the sound proceeded, and waited
patiently to see him &ldquo;gaily flit from bough to bough&rdquo;;
but no bird came into view. She went around the tree
until, to her delight, she discovered him sitting on the nest,
only a few feet from where she stood. He stopped singing
when he saw her, but showed neither surprise nor fear,
and resumed his song after she went away. She realized
that she had had an unusually rare privilege.</p>
<p>To hear a grosbeak&rsquo;s song at night is an experience
similar to that of listening to a nightingale in Europe, or
to a mockingbird in our South or West, singing by moonlight.</p>
<h2>THE BLUE GROSBEAK
<br /><i>Finch Family&mdash;Fringillid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: 7 inches; indigo bunting, 5&frac12; inches.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Body a deep blue, almost black on the back; chin and

blue; wings black, tipped with bright brown, giving
the effect of one broad and one narrow wing-bar.
Winter plumage, rusty brown mottled with blue.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Grayish-brown above, more or less washed with blue;

with buff.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A sweet grosbeak warble.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern North America. Breeds from Missouri,
southern Illinois and Maryland, south to eastern
Texas, and northern Florida; accidental in Wisconsin,
New England, the Maritime Provinces, and
Cuba; winters in Yucatan and Honduras.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>The Blue Grosbeak resembles its smaller relative,
the indigo bunting, but it has a larger, darker body,
a heavier bill, and brown-tipped wing feathers. It is
more nearly the size of a cowbird than of the indigo-bird.
It may be found in thickets similar to those frequented by
its small blue relative.</p>
<p>It is a bird of the southeastern part of the United States,
but occasionally strays northward.</p>
<h2>THE EVENING GROSBEAK
<br /><i>Finch Family&mdash;Fringillid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: 8 inches; 3 inches larger than the goldfinch.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Forehead bright yellow; crown of head black; body
olive-brown, with yellow on shoulders, rump, and
belly; wings black and white; tail forked, black;
bill heavy and yellowish.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Brownish-gray, tinged with yellow underneath; wings
black and white; forked tail black, tipped with
white.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Central North America. Breeds in western Alberta;
winters in the interior of North America east of the
Rocky Mts., more or less irregularly in southern
Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio, eastern Pennsylvania, New
York, New Jersey, New England, and Quebec.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A sight of this handsome bird is an event in the East,
and arouses great interest in people who know how
rare it is. Five were seen near Washington in early April
of this year, and were hailed with enthusiasm. It is a
common resident of our Northwest, though it wanders in
flocks to the East occasionally.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>It looks like a large goldfinch, though it is a less brilliant
yellow, has larger patches of white on its wings and
wears its dark cap back on its head, above its yellow forehead,
instead of pulled down to its eyes and bill. It
blends perfectly with the yellows and olive-browns of some
of our western landscapes.</p>
<p>It feeds on berries, seeds, and insects. It becomes very
tame.</p>
<h2>THE BLACK-HEADED GROSBEAK
<br /><i>Finch Family&mdash;Fringillid&aelig;</i></h2>
<p>The Black-headed Grosbeak has <i>cinnamon-brown</i>
upper parts, breast, band about the neck, and
rump; yellow belly, black head, wings, and tail; wings
with two white bars and a white patch; tail with white
tips. Female brownish-black and buff above; under parts
tawny and yellow, streaked with dark; chin, sides of
throat, and line over eye whitish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Black-headed Grosbeak takes the place in the
West of the rosebreast of the East, and, like it, is a fine
songster. Like it, also, the blackhead readily resorts to
orchards and gardens and is common in agricultural districts.
The bird has a very powerful bill and easily
crushes or cuts into the firmest fruit. It feeds upon
cherries, apricots, and other fruits, and also does some
damage to peas and beans, but it is so active a foe of
certain horticultural pests that we can afford to overlook
its faults.... It eats scale insects, cankerworms, codling
moths, and many flower beetles, which do incalculable
damage to cultivated flowers and to ripe fruit.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_110" href="#fn_110">[110]</a></p>

<h2>THE BOBOLINK
<br /><i>American Blackbird Family&mdash;Icterid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: A little over 7 inches.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: <i>Spring</i> or <i>Breeding plumage</i>: Crown, sides of head,
throat, and other under parts black; <i>back of head
and neck light yellow</i>; upper half of back black,
streaked with creamy white; <i>lower half of back,
rump, and shoulders white</i>; wings black, some of the
feathers tipped with buff; tail black, the feathers
pointed. Many birds have dark upper parts and
light breasts; the bobolink wears his bright breast
upon his back during the summer. In the fall, he
resembles the female.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Olive-brown and light yellow above, with black
streaks; head with olive-brown and light yellow
stripes; under parts pale yellow; wings and tail
brown.</p>
<p><b>Notes</b>: A tinkling <i>ding-ding</i>, not unlike the sound of a bell;
likewise a chirp.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A bubbling song, full of ecstasy and abandon. It is
one of the most delightful songs of the later migrants.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: While in the North, the bobolink inhabits our fields
and meadows, where he &ldquo;swings on brier and weed.&rdquo;
In the fall, he frequents the rice-fields of our southern
states on his way to South America, and does
so much harm that he is dreaded and hated.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: North and South America. Breeds mainly from the
plains of south-central Canada to Nevada, Utah,
northern Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia,
Pennsylvania, and New Jersey; winters in
South America, to southern Brazil, Paraguay, and
Bolivia.</p>

<p>Had Robert Louis Stevenson written the biography
of a bobolink, he might have given him the
names of his immortal Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, for the
bird seems to possess a dual nature, and to bear totally
different reputations in the North and the South. When
he visits Canada and northern United States in May,
dressed in his gay wedding finery, he is greeted with joy.
Few more delightful birds are to be found than this attractive,
happy-hearted singer against whom no reproaches
are registered in the North.</p>
<p>His song has been a favorite theme for poets and nature-writers.
Thoreau wrote: &ldquo;One or two notes globe
themselves and fall in bubbles from his teeming throat.
It is as if he touched his harp within a vase of liquid melody,
and when he lifted it out, the notes fell like bubbles
from the strings. Methinks they are the most liquidly
sweet and melodious sounds I ever heard.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_111" href="#fn_111">[111]</a></p>
<p>The bobolink&rsquo;s habits in the North are almost beyond
reproach. Professor Beal writes: &ldquo;In New England there
are few birds about which so much romance clusters as
this rollicking songster, naturally associated with the June
meadows; but in the South there are none on whose head
so many maledictions have been heaped on account of its
fondness for rice. During its sojourn in the Northern
States it feeds mainly upon insects and seeds of useless
plants; but while rearing its young, insects constitute its
chief food, and almost the exclusive diet of its brood.
After the young are able to fly, the whole family gathers
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
into a small flock and begins to live almost entirely upon
vegetable food. This consists for the most part of weed
seeds, since in the North these birds do not appear to attack
grain to any extent. They eat a few oats.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_112" href="#fn_112">[112]</a></p>
<p>Dr. Henshaw adds: &ldquo;When the young are well on the
wing, they gather in flocks with the parent birds and gradually
move southward, being then generally known as <i>reed-birds</i>.
They reach the ricefields of the Carolinas about
August 20, when the rice is in the milk. Then until the
birds depart for South America, planters and birds fight
for the crop, and in spite of constant watchfulness and
innumerable devices for scaring the birds a loss of 10
per cent. of the rice is the usual result.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_113" href="#fn_113">[113]</a></p>
<p>Major Bendire, in his &ldquo;Life Histories of North American
Birds,&rdquo; quotes a letter from Capt. W. M. Hazzard, a
large rice-grower of South Carolina, written concerning
the warfare waged against these <i>ricebirds</i>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bobolinks make their appearance here during the
latter part of April. At that season, their plumage is
white and black, and they sing merrily when at rest.
Their flight is always at night. In the evening there are
none. In the morning their appearance is heralded by
the popping of whips and firing of musketry by the bird-minders
in their efforts to keep the birds from pulling up
the young rice. This warfare is kept up incessantly until
about the 25th of May, when they suddenly disappear
at night. Their next appearance is in a dark yellow
plumage, as the <i>Ricebird</i>. There is no song at this time,
but instead a chirp which means ruin to any rice found in
the milk. My plantation record will show that for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_215">215</span>
past ten years, except when prevented by stormy south
or southwest winds, the Ricebirds have come punctually
on the night of the 21st of August, apparently coming
from seaward. All night their chirp can be heard passing
over our summer homes on South Island, which is
situated 6 miles to the east of our rice plantations, in full
view of the ocean. Curious to say, we have never seen
this flight during the day. During the nights of August
21, 22, 23, and 24, millions of these birds make their appearance
and settle in the ricefields. From the 21st of
August to the 25th of September our every effort is made
to save the crop. Men, boys, and women with guns and
ammunition, are posted.... The firing commences at
dawn and is kept up till sunset.... If from any cause
there is a check to the crop during its growth which prevents
the grain from being hard, but in milky condition,
the destruction of such fields is complete, it not paying to
cut and bring the rice out of the field.... I consider
these birds as destructive to rice as the caterpillar is to
cotton, with this difference, that these Ricebirds never fail
to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In winter, the goldfinch may be distinguished from
others of the finch or sparrow family by its undulating

<p>The Goldfinch or &ldquo;Wild Canary&rdquo; is one of our best-loved
birds. The beauty of the male&rsquo;s coloring, the sweetness
of his voice, the joyousness of his nature have won
him many friends.</p>
<p>John Burroughs wrote: &ldquo;The goldfinch has many
pretty ways. So far as my knowledge goes, he is not capable
of one harsh note. His tones are either joyous or
plaintive. In his spring reunions they are joyous. In the
peculiar flight song in which he indulges in the mating
season, beating the air vertically with his round open
wings, his tones are fairly ecstatic. His call to his mate
when she is brooding, and when he circles about her in that
long, billowy flight, the crests of his airy waves being thirty
or forty feet apart, calling, &lsquo;Perchic-o-pee, perchic-o-pee,&rsquo;
as if he were saying, &lsquo;For love of thee, for love of thee,&rsquo; and
she calling back, &lsquo;Yes, dearie; yes, dearie&rsquo;&mdash;his tones at
such times express contentment and reassurance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When any of his natural enemies appear&mdash;a hawk,
a cat, a jay,&mdash;his tones are plaintive in sorrow and not
in anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When with his mate he leads their brood about the
August thistles, the young call in a similar tone. When
in July the nesting has begun, the female talks the prettiest
&lsquo;baby talk&rsquo; to her mate as he feeds her. The nest-building
rarely begins till thistledown can be had, so literally
are all the ways of this darling bird ways of
softness and gentleness. The nest is a thick, soft, warm
structure, securely fastened in the fork of a maple or an
apple-tree.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_114" href="#fn_114">[114]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>The fondness of goldfinches for the seeds of thistles has
given them the name of <i>thistle-birds</i>. While they eat insects
during the summer, they are especially useful as
seed-destroyers. At Marshall Hall, Md., Dr. Judd observed
them eating their first fresh supply in the spring
from dandelions; in June, they ate the seeds of the field
daisy; in July, of the purple aster and wild carrot.
Thistles and wild lettuce were feasted upon during August;
while in September the troublesome beggar-tick and ragweed
were eagerly sought. At one time Dr. Judd counted
a flock of three hundred goldfinches busily stripping
seeds from a rank growth of the latter weed; he discovered
them, also, devouring seeds of the trumpet-creeper.
They are invaluable aids to a farmer; the only fault of
which they can be accused is that of &ldquo;pilfering&rdquo; sunflower
seeds. The presence of sunflowers in a garden is likely
to attract goldfinches, just as trumpet-creeper blossoms
lure hummingbirds.</p>
<p>I recall a lovely garden in which I spent many pleasant
hours one summer, happy in its beauty and fragrance,
and in the companionship of bird visitors. Near my accustomed
seat grew a clump of sunflowers, often sought
by goldfinches. The black and gold of their plumage
made a pretty sight against the yellow petals and dark
centers of the great flowers. I remember one little bird
that fluttered among the golden petals, too busy singing
to eat for a time.</p>
<p>Two bird-hunting cats haunted the garden. I took a
malicious pleasure in driving them away, because their
ignorant, parsimonious owner had informed me that she
kept them locked up while her chickens were young, so
the cats wouldn&rsquo;t catch them. She didn&rsquo;t care how many
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
birds were killed, for then she wouldn&rsquo;t be obliged to feed
the prowlers. The goldfinches soon learned that when I
was there they could feast in safety. More than once
when I was in the house or on the porch I would hear their
alarm cry of <i>D&eacute;-de? d&eacute;-de?</i> sound from a maple near the
piazza, plainly calling for my aid. When I went out to
the garden and drove away their feline foes, the cries
would cease. The angry owner of the cats, who dared
not remonstrate further with me, cut down the sunflowers!</p>
<p>My most beautiful memory of goldfinches is associated
with one of their spring mating-festivals. My sister and
I had read Burroughs&rsquo;s description of these love-feasts, so
we were prepared to understand what the unusual chorus
meant. The sweet call-notes of the males, interspersed
with rapturous bursts of melody and frequent flutterings
met with quick response from the olive-and-gold females,
who chirped and said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; with a joy pleasant to see!
It is impossible to convey adequately any idea of the exquisite
tenderness of their voices, of the absence of quarreling
and jealousies,&mdash;of the perfect harmony of the proceeding.
I can only wish that every person who loves
birds might some time have the pleasure of a similar experience.</p>

<h2>THE CATBIRD
<br /><i>Mockingbird Family&mdash;Mimid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: Nearly 9 inches.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: A slender, long-tailed, gray bird, with a
<i>black crown</i> and <i>tail</i>, and <i>chestnut-brown feathers
under the tail</i>; breast somewhat paler than back; bill
slightly curved.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: A soft <i>w&#259;</i>, not unlike the mew of a kitten.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A delightful warble&mdash;soft, sweet, and musical, though
it is occasionally interspersed with the catlike noise
<i>w&#259;</i>, and with sounds of mimicry. Catbirds are
sometimes called northern mockingbirds.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Tangled thickets preferred. Fruit trees, berry-patches,
and garden-shrubbery are also sought.</p>
<p><b>Nest</b>: A veritable scrap-basket made of twigs, leaves, grasses,
plant-fibers and rootlets, with paper sometimes interwoven.
One nest that I examined contained a scrap
from a torn letter and a fragment of a sermon from
a newspaper. Several tell-tale cherry-stones lay on
the bottom, circumstantial evidence of theft.</p>
<p><b>Eggs</b>: A lovely greenish-blue, not unlike those of the robin.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: A common bird of eastern North America, from central
Canada to the Gulf and northern Florida. It
is found in the northwestern part of the U. S. and
winters in our southern states and in Central America.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The catbird is well-named. It is the color of a Maltese
cat, is sleek and agile, and in movement quiet
and stealthy. Its mew is so like that of a kitten as to be
confusing to the uninitiated. I recall the frantic barking
of our small dog at a catbird that she heard in the shrubbery
one day. It was difficult to convince her that one of
her hated foes, a cat, was not the author of the sound that
always infuriated her.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>Though catbirds possess little claim to beauty, they
seem to be vain and appear always to be doing something
to attract attention. They are in constant motion&mdash;twitching
their tails, jerking their bodies, and making their
gentle, inane &ldquo;cat-calls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I once had an amusing experience with a catbird. I
had seated myself near a thicket in which a Maryland
Yellow-throat was flitting. Hoping to beguile him from
the shrubbery and thus afford myself a better view of him,
I gave his song repeatedly&mdash;&ldquo;Witch-a-tee-o, witch-a-tee-o.&rdquo;
A catbird on the fence-rail behind the thicket was flirting
his tail, looking knowingly at me, and giving his call repeatedly.
I paid no attention to him, and continued to
say &ldquo;Witch-a-tee-o.&rdquo; It was not long before he, too, warbled
&ldquo;Witch-a-tee-o.&rdquo; Whether he did it from his love of
mimicry or from a desire to be noticed, I shall never know,
but his bearing was, &ldquo;<i>Now</i> will you pay some attention
to <i>me</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catbirds are in disfavor among the growers of cherries
and berries, both wild and cultivated; they make havoc in
strawberry-beds. Mr. Forbush reports that their depredations
vary in different localities. He claims that in
spite of their fruit-stealing propensities they deserve protection
in Massachusetts, because they devour locusts, cankerworms,
and the caterpillars of various moths, most important
being those of the gypsy and brown-tail moths.</p>
<p>In the Biological Survey Bulletin &ldquo;Fifty Common Birds
of Farm and Orchard&rdquo; (No. 513) the following statements
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
about the catbird are made: &ldquo;Half of its food consists of
fruit, and the cultivated crops most often injured are cherries,
strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries. Beetles,
ants, crickets, and grasshoppers are the most important
element of its animal food. The bird is known to
attack a few pests such as cutworms, leaf beetles, clover-root
curculio, and the periodical cicada, but the good it
does in this way probably does not pay for the fruit it
steals. The extent to which it should be protected may
perhaps be left to the individual cultivator; that is, it
should be made lawful to destroy catbirds that are doing
manifest damage to crops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Judd found that catbirds fed their young almost entirely
on insects; he therefore scored a point in their favor.
Their bravery in defense of their nest and their young is
well known.</p>
<p>Burroughs tells an unusual anecdote about a catbird as
follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend of mine who had a summer home on one of
the trout-streams of the Catskills discovered that the catbird
was fond of butter, and she soon had one of the birds
coming every day to the dining-room, perching on the back
of the chair, and receiving its morsel of butter from a
fork held in the mistress&rsquo;s hand. I think the butter was
unsalted. My friend was convinced after three years that
the same pair of birds returned to her each year because
each season the male came promptly for his butter.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_115" href="#fn_115">[115]</a></p>
<p>Many other incidents might be related concerning this
interesting bird,&mdash;of its unusual intelligence and its remarkable
power of mimicry. One catbird in Tennessee
learned to imitate the songs of all the birds that nested
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
near him. His rendering of the red-eyed vireo&rsquo;s song was
as good as that of the vireo himself. His listeners felt
that it was wearisome enough to have the red-eye preaching
constantly, but to have the catbird reiterating it was
more than they could endure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<h2>THE BROWN THRASHER
<br /><i>Mockingbird Family&mdash;Mimid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 11 inches, larger than the robin; tail 5 inches
long.</p>
<p><b>General Appearance</b>: A large bird with a <i>bright brown back,
white breast streaked with brownish-black</i>, and a
<i>very long tail</i> which is moved or &ldquo;thrashed&rdquo; about
incessantly.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: Reddish-brown above; white underneath,
becoming buff after the August molt; throat indistinctly
marked with dark streaks; breast and sides
<i>heavily streaked</i>; wings with two indistinct white
bars; tail almost half the length of the bird; bill
long (about 1 inch), sharp and curving.</p>
<p><b>Notes</b>: A &ldquo;smacking&rdquo; sound and a sharp <i>whew</i>.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A loud, clear, beautiful song. It consists of several
phrases, each composed of two or more similar notes.
Thoreau interpreted it as follows: &ldquo;<i>cherruit, cherruit,
cherruit; go ahead, go ahead; give it to him, give it to him</i>.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_116" href="#fn_116">[116]</a> The song is generally sung from
the tops of trees or bushes.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Like the catbird, the thrasher is found frequently in
shrubbery, where it scratches among dead leaves for
its food. Its brown color protects it admirably.</p>
<p><b>Nest</b>: Made of twigs, leaves, and root-fibers, placed in thickets
or on the ground.</p>
<p><b>Eggs</b>: White, evenly speckled with fine brown spots.</p>
<p><b>Food</b>: Wild fruit and berries (30 kinds), and insects, especially
beetles and caterpillars. Professor Beal says:
&ldquo;The farmer has nothing to fear from depredations
on fruit or grain by the brown thrasher. The bird
is a resident of groves and swamps rather than of
orchards and gardens.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_117" href="#fn_117">[117]</a></p>
<div class="img" id="fig47">
<img src="images/i339.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="721" />
<p class="caption">BROWN THRASHER</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern United States and southern Canada, westward
to the Rocky Mts.; winters in south-eastern United
States.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because of his brown color and his speckled
breast, the Brown Thrasher has often been erroneously
called the <i>Brown Thrush</i>. Careful observation
reveals many points of difference. He is three or four
inches longer than our common thrushes&mdash;in fact, his tail
alone is only about 2&frac12; inches shorter than the entire body
of the veery or the hermit thrush; his bill is almost four
times as long as theirs and is decidedly curved. Instead
of dark, thrush-like eyes, he has pale yellow ones that give
him an uncanny appearance.</p>
<p>He is not a dweller in woods, but, like the catbird, prefers
thickets. Burroughs says: &ldquo;The furtive and stealthy
manners of the catbird contrast strongly with the frank
open manners of the thrushes. Its cousin the brown
thrasher goes skulking about in much the same way, flirting
from bush to bush like a culprit escaping from justice.
But he does love to sing from the April treetops where all
the world may see and hear, if said world does not come
too near.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_118" href="#fn_118">[118]</a></p>
<p>His song is a brilliant, delightful performance, admirable
in technique, but lacking in a quality of tone that
moves the heart. It is often of long duration. One May
afternoon, I heard a thrasher singing so long that I was
moved to time him. He sang without stopping for fifteen
<span class="pb" id="Page_226">226</span>
minutes by my watch, and his entire song must have lasted
nearly half an hour.</p>
<p>The brown thrasher, like the other members of his family,
has power of mimicry. In the north, he is sometimes
called the &ldquo;Northern Mocker&rdquo;; in some regions where he
and the mockingbird both live, he is known as the &ldquo;Sandy
Mocker.&rdquo; There is sufficient similarity in the songs of the
catbird, the thrasher, and the mockingbird to make a listener
pause a moment to distinguish them when in a locality
where the three birds are to be found. The catbird&rsquo;s
mew betrays him; the thrasher&rsquo;s song is more brilliant
and sustained; the mocker&rsquo;s more varied. Thoreau
says, &ldquo;The thrasher has a sort of laugh in his strain that
the catbird has not.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_119" href="#fn_119">[119]</a> His song resembles decidedly that
of the English thrush, famed in poetry. Browning&rsquo;s description
of the latter is equally applicable to our thrasher:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;He sings each song twice over,</p>
<p class="t0">Lest you should think he never could recapture</p>
<p class="t0">That first fine careless rapture.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE MOCKINGBIRD
<br /><i>Mockingbird Family&mdash;Mimid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 10 inches; an inch longer than the catbird
and an inch shorter than the thrasher; tail about
5 inches long.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: A long, slender, brownish-gray bird, with
grayish-white under parts; wings and tail dark
brown; wings with two white bars and <i>white patches
that are conspicuous in flight</i>; middle tail-feathers
brown, <i>outer feathers white, others partly white</i>.
The female frequently has less white than the male.</p>
<p><b>Notes</b>: A great variety. Some mockingbirds seem to possess
unlimited powers of mimicry; others have far less
ability to reproduce sounds.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A sweet, delightful melody, sung in pure liquid tones
and with ease and assurance, as though the birds
were conscious of their power. They are probably
the most famous songsters of America. Sidney
Lanier, Walt Whitman, and other poets have written
well-known poems in their praise, while Roosevelt
and many other prose-writers have added their encomiums.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Near the haunts of man, in gardens, parks, tree-shaded
streets, and groves.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Southeastern United States chiefly from eastern Nebraska,
southern Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and
Maryland, south to eastern Texas, southern Florida
and the Bahamas; occasional in New York and
Massachusetts, though a number of records have been

Maine, and Nova Scotia; introduced into Bermuda.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p class="bq">The <span class="small">WESTERN MOCKINGBIRD</span> is found in California,
southern Wyoming, northwestern Nebraska, and western
Kansas, south to Mexico and Lower California.
It has a longer tail and wings than the eastern species,
and is a paler gray.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nuttall called the Mockingbird &ldquo;the unrivalled
Orpheus of the forest, and the natural wonder of
America.&rdquo; His voice certainly has power to &ldquo;soothe the
savage breast,&rdquo; to interest the mind because of the varied
range and remarkable technique, and to uplift the soul,
especially when heard in the stillness and beauty of a
moonlight night.</p>
<p>There is great difference of opinion regarding the
&ldquo;mocker.&rdquo; He is more loved and admired in the South
than in the West, and is regarded with pride as worthy to
be called the nightingale of America. Most writers have
sung his praises, but occasionally some one regards him
with disfavor because of his habit of interlarding his beautiful
song with curious and disagreeable sounds. Wilson
Flagg says, &ldquo;He often brings his tiresome extravaganzas
to a magnificent climax of melody and as frequently concludes
an inimitable chant with a most contemptible bathos.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_120" href="#fn_120">[120]</a></p>
<p>The power of mimicry varies with different individuals.
In a brief interval of time, one bird may imitate a woodpecker,
a ph&oelig;be, a wren, a jay, or a cardinal, so as to
deceive most listeners. He may produce the sound made
by the popping of a cork or the buzzing of a saw; the next
moment he may scream like a hawk to frighten chickens
and send them to cover, or cluck like an old hen and bring
<span class="pb" id="Page_229">229</span>
young chicks from their hiding-places. Some mockers
seem to be able to reproduce the bird-songs they hear more
melodiously than the singers themselves render them.</p>
<p>Mockingbirds&rsquo; bravery in defense of their nests and
their young is well known. They have an especial antipathy
to dogs and cats, and are merciless in their attacks
on those animals if seen near the vicinity of their nests.
A friend in California told me that her cat was in abject
terror of a mockingbird. Instead of considering him
tempting prey, she invariably fled to cover when he appeared,
and remained in hiding for a time. The fur on
her sides was noticeably thinned where the angry bird had
pulled out numerous locks. One day, while my family
were visiting San Francisco, they heard a dog yelping piteously
and discovered him running at lightning speed
down the middle of the street. A mockingbird was
perched on his back and was pulling hairs out of his tail
with spiteful tweaks. Mockers have been known to kill
snakes that approached their nests, and to attack human
beings with great fury.</p>
<p>They like to live near people and seem to respond to the
affection shown them in the South, where they are such
favorites that they are seldom molested. Formerly mockingbirds
were trapped for cage-birds, as were cardinals,
but this practice is largely discontinued now, because of
protective laws and aroused public sentiment.</p>
<p>Dr. Henry W. Henshaw says: &ldquo;It is not surprising that
the mockingbird should receive protection principally because
of its ability as a songster and its preference for the
vicinity of dwellings. Its place in the affections of the
South is similar to that occupied by the robin in the
North. It is well that this is true, for the bird appears
<span class="pb" id="Page_230">230</span>
not to earn protection from a strictly economic standpoint.
About half of its diet consists of fruit, and many cultivated
varieties are attacked, such as oranges, grapes, figs,
strawberries, blackberries, and raspberries. Somewhat
less than a fourth of the food is animal matter, of which
grasshoppers are the largest single element. The bird is
fond of cottonworms, and is known to feed on the chinch
bug, rice weevil, and bollworm. It is unfortunate that it
does not feed on injurious insects to an extent to offset its
depredations on fruit.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_121" href="#fn_121">[121]</a></p>
<p>Professor Beal says, however, &ldquo;The mockingbird will
probably do little harm to cultivated fruits so long as wild
varieties are accessible and abundant.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_122" href="#fn_122">[122]</a> Wise cultivators
of fruit take this into consideration and plant accordingly,
to keep both their fruit and the delightful, amusing mockingbirds.</p>

<p class="caption">YELLOW-BILLED CUCKOO</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<h2>THE YELLOW-BILLED CUCKOO
<br /><i>Cuckoo Family&mdash;Cuculid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 12 inches; tail over 6 inches.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: Brownish-gray above with a greenish tinge;
white underneath; <i>reddish-brown wings</i>; feathers
brightest on inner web; middle tail feathers brownish-gray;
outer ones <i>black, broadly tipped with white,
tips decreasing in size toward center</i>; <i>lower mandible
of bill yellow</i> except at the end.</p>
<p><b>Notes</b>: A rapid, guttural utterance of the words <i>cook-cook-cook-cook</i>
and <i>cow-cow-cow-cow</i>. Our cuckoos sometimes
give a cooing note, but do not say <i>cuck&prime;-oo</i>
like their European relatives.</p>
<p><b>Flight</b>: Swift and difficult to observe, as the cuckoo glides
rapidly from bough to bough, under cover if possible.</p>
<p><b>Nest</b>: A loosely-constructed platform of sticks.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Orchards, woodlands, park-like estates, and quiet
shady streets. Cuckoos are occasionally seen in exposed,
sunny places.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern North America. Breeds from southern Canada
and northern United States as far west as North
Dakota and as far south as northern Louisiana and
Florida; winters south to Argentina.</p>
<p class="bq">The <span class="small">BLACK-BILLED CUCKOO</span> is similar to the Yellow-bill
in general appearance, but has several marked
differences. Its upper parts are more greenish; its
tail-feathers have smaller white tips; its wings are
<i>gray, not reddish-brown</i>; its bill is <i>black</i>, not <i>yellow</i>;
its eye-ring is red.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>Cuckoos seem to have less individuality than many
of our birds; they resemble several of them.
They are not unlike catbirds in their quiet, stealthy movements;
they are slender, gray-and-white, and long-tailed
like mockingbirds; they build nests somewhat like those
of mourning doves.</p>
<p>They are shy, solitary birds, that are known by their
note rather than by sight. I never heard of any one but
Wordsworth and Wilson Flagg who loved cuckoos or called
them &ldquo;darlings of the spring.&rdquo; The European cuckoo has,
however, a very different nature and a more joyous note.</p>
<p>Burroughs is most amusing in his comments. He says:
&ldquo;We cannot hail our black-billed as &lsquo;blithe newcomer,&rsquo; as
Wordsworth does his cuckoo. &lsquo;Doleful newcomer,&rsquo; would
be a fitter title. There is nothing cheery or animated in
his note, and he is about as much a &lsquo;wandering voice&rsquo; as
is the European bird. He does not babble of sunshine
and of flowers. He is a prophet of the rain, and the
country people call him the rain crow. All his notes are
harsh and verge on the weird.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_123" href="#fn_123">[123]</a></p>
<p>He is, however, worthy of consideration. He is of great
value to farmers and apple-growers because of his appetite
for caterpillars and grasshoppers. Professor Beal
wrote as follows: &ldquo;The common observation that cuckoos
feed largely on caterpillars has been confirmed by stomach
examination. Furthermore, they appear to prefer
the hairy and spiny species, which are supposed to be protected
from the attacks of birds. The extent to which
cuckoos eat hairy caterpillars is shown by the inner coatings
of the stomachs, which frequently are so pierced by
these hairs and spines that they are completely furred.
<span class="pb" id="Page_233">233</span>
The apple-tree tent-caterpillar and the red-humped apple-caterpillar
are also eaten. In all, caterpillars constitute
two-thirds of the total food of the yellow-billed cuckoo in
the South. Few birds feed so exclusively upon any one
order of insects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The natural food for cuckoos would seem to be bugs
and caterpillars which feed upon leaves, as these birds
live in the shade among the leaves of trees and bushes.
Not so with grasshoppers, whose favorite haunts are on the
ground in the blazing sunshine, yet these creatures are the
second largest item in the cuckoo&rsquo;s diet. Grasshoppers
are so agreeable an article of food that many a bird apparently
forsakes its usual feeding grounds and takes to
the earth for them. Thus it is with the cuckoos; they
quit their cool, shady retreats in order to gratify their
taste for these insects of the hot sunshine. But there are
some members of the grasshopper order that live in the
shade, as katydids, tree crickets, and ground crickets, and
these are all used to vary the cuckoo&rsquo;s bill of fare.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_124" href="#fn_124">[124]</a> It
eats, also, bugs that injure oranges and melons, and the
cotton-boll weevil in large numbers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<h2>THE LEAST FLYCATCHER OR CHEBEC
<br /><i>Flycatcher Family&mdash;Tyrannid&aelig;</i></h2>
<p>In March, there comes to us from the South the ph&oelig;be,
inconspicuous in plumage, yet easy to identify because
of its distinctive call. About a month later there
arrives the smallest member of our Flycatchers,&mdash;the Chebec
or Least-Flycatcher. Less than five and a half inches
in length, slender, olive-brown above, grayish-white beneath
with an indistinct grayish band across the breast,
this little bird might escape our notice were it not for its
oft repeated and unmistakable call-note. It announces its
presence by uttering its name <i>Chebec</i>, as clearly and persistently
as its cousins, the ph&oelig;be and pewee, say theirs.</p>
<p>The chebec is a bird to be found in orchards, by roadsides,
and in trees of village streets. Like other members
of its family it seeks conspicuous perches, from which
it dives after flies, moths, and other insects, returning to
its perch to wheeze out its name, with jerks and twitches
of its tail.</p>
<p>It breeds from central Canada to central United States
as far south as Nebraska, Iowa, Indiana, Pennsylvania,
and New Jersey, and in the Alleghany Mts. to North Carolina;
winters from Mexico to Panama and Peru.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<h2>THE KINGBIRD
<br /><i>Flycatcher Family&mdash;Tyrannid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 8&frac12; inches.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: Upper parts dark gray; under parts pure
white, with an indistinct grayish wash at the sides of
the breast; <i>head grayish-black, slightly crested, with
a concealed orange patch</i>; bill with bristles at the
base; wing-feathers and upper tail-coverts tipped or
edged with white; <i>tail fan-shaped in flight, showing
a broad white band at the end</i>.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: An unmusical, rattling <i>Squeak-squeak? squeak-squeak-squeak?</i>
uttered frequently, and apparently in an
irritated mood. The sharply hooked beak and fierce-looking
eye also give the appearance of pugnacity.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Orchards, trees by roadsides, and near farm-buildings.
One looks for the kingbird in open country,
not in woodlands; he seeks conspicuous perches.
The nests are placed in trees&mdash;in those of orchards
preferably.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: North and South America. Breeds from South-central
Canada and throughout the United States except in
the south-west; winters from Mexico to South
America.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No more interesting description of the Kingbird has
come to my attention than that by Major Bendire.
He writes as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Few of our birds are better known throughout the
United States than the Kingbird. Bold and fearless in
character, yet tame and confiding in man, often preferring
to live in close proximity to dwellings, in gardens
<span class="pb" id="Page_236">236</span>
and orchards, they are prime favorites with the majority
of our farming population, and they well deserve their
fullest protection. Few birds are more useful to the farmer;
their reputation for pugnacity and reckless courage
is so well established that it is almost needless to dwell
on it, as it is well known that they will boldly attack and
drive off the largest of our Raptores, should one venture
too near to their chosen nesting-sites.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where a pair or more of these birds make their home
in the vicinity of a farmhouse, the poultry yard is not
likely to suffer much through feathered marauders at least;
they are a perfect terror to all hawks, instantly darting at
them and rising above them, alighting on their shoulders
or necks, and picking away at them most unmercifully
until they are only too willing to beat a hasty retreat.
The male is seemingly always on the lookout from his
perch on the top branches of a tree or post for such enemies
and no matter how large they may be, a pair of Kingbirds
is more than a match for any of them, our larger Falcons
and Eagles not excepted. Crows and Blue Jays seem to
be especially obnoxious to them, and instances are on record
where they have done them material injury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Major Bendire says also that kingbirds do not &ldquo;bully&rdquo;
all birds, but &ldquo;as a rule live in harmony with them, protecting
not only their own nests but those of their small
neighbors as well, who frequently place their nests within
a few feet of the Kingbirds&mdash;the Orchard Oriole, for instance.&rdquo;
He tells however, of the kingbird&rsquo;s dislike of
the hummingbird&mdash;that he has twice seen the tiny &ldquo;aggressor&rdquo;
put the larger bird to flight.<a class="fn" id="fr_125" href="#fn_125">[125]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>Kingbirds were for a long time believed to eat bees and
therefore were in disfavor. They were called Bee-birds
or Bee-Martins and were shot by bee-keepers who did not
understand their great value. Professor Beal and other
investigators in the Biological Department at Washington
have discovered that ninety per cent. of kingbirds&rsquo; food
consists of insects, mostly injurious beetles that prey upon
grain and fruit. They occasionally eat bees, but examination
of many stomachs reveals a marked preference for
drones over workers, and for wasps, wild bees, and ants
over hive bees.<a class="fn" id="fr_126" href="#fn_126">[126]</a> So kingbirds have been exonerated.</p>
<h2>THE GRAY KINGBIRD
<br /><i>Flycatcher Family&mdash;Tyrannid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 9 inches.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: Upper parts light gray, darker about the
cheeks; concealed orange patch on the crown; under
parts whitish, washed with gray on the breast; wings
and tail brownish; <i>no white band on the tail</i>, like
the northern kingbird; <i>bill very heavy&mdash;almost an
inch long</i>, with bristles at the base.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: A loud call, <i>Pit-tear&prime;-re</i>, &ldquo;which is constant and is at
times lengthened and softened until it might almost
be called a song.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_127" href="#fn_127">[127]</a> The natives of Porto Rico call
the bird &ldquo;pitir&prime;re&rdquo; because of its note.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Breeds from Georgia, southeastern South Carolina,
Florida, and Yucatan, through the Bahamas and
West Indies to northern South America; winters
from the Greater Antilles southward. It is common
in our southeastern states.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>The following is an extract from Dr. Wetmore&rsquo;s interesting
description of the Gray Kingbird in the
bulletin, &ldquo;Birds of Porto Rico,&rdquo; used with the permission
of the author:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gray kingbird has the reputation among the country
people of being the earliest riser among birds. In the
daytime it scatters along the slopes and through the fields
to feed, but at nightfall gathers in small parties along
streams to roost in the bamboos or in the mangroves surrounding
the lagoons. The nesting season extends from
April to July and during the latter month young are abundant.
At all times very pugnacious, pursuing blackbirds,
hawks, and other birds, they now become doubly so, resenting
all intrusions in their neighborhood. Occasionally
they were seen standing on open perches during showers
with outspread trembling wings, evidently enjoying the
downpour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few facts regarding the insect food of this kingbird
were learned from field observation. Birds were
twice observed eating the caterpillars of a large sphinx
moth. These were beaten on a limb, and then the juices
were extracted by working the body through the bill, while
only the skin was discarded. Their services in eating
these and other caterpillars were recognized.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE CRESTED FLYCATCHER
<br /><i>Flycatcher Family&mdash;Tyrannid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 9 inches.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: <i>Olive-gray above; throat and breast light
gray; belly, bright yellow; head conspicuously
crested</i>; bill, long, dark, slightly hooked, with bristles
at its base; wings brown, margined with white,
pale yellow, and reddish-brown; middle tail-feathers,
dull brown; inner web of other tail-feathers reddish-brown.</p>
<p><b>Notes</b>: A whistle that attracts attention. Major Bendire describes
the &ldquo;Great Crest&rsquo;s&rdquo; notes as follows:</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;It utters a variety of sounds; the most common
is a clear whistle like <i>e-whuit-huit</i>, or <i>wit-whit, wit-whit</i>,
repeated five or six times in a somewhat lower
key, and varied to <i>whuir</i>, <i>whuree</i>, or <i>puree</i>, accompanied
by various turnings and twistings of the
head. Its alarm-note is a penetrating and far-reaching
<i>wh&#275;&#275;k, wh&#275;&#275;k</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Nest</b>: The nest of the crested flycatcher is unique. Major
Bendire says that it &ldquo;is usually placed in a natural
cavity of some tree or dead stump; possibly in an
abandoned woodpecker excavation, though a natural
one is preferred.&rdquo; He says also that &ldquo;nests
vary in bulk; are begun with a base of coarse trash
and finished with fine twigs, bunches of cattle hair,
pine needles, dry leaves and grasses, the tail of a
rabbit, pieces of catbirds&rsquo; eggshells, exuvi&aelig; of
snakes, owl and hawk feathers, tufts of woodchucks&rsquo;
hair and fine grass roots.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="bq">Snake-skins &ldquo;seem to be present in the majority of
<span class="pb" id="Page_240">240</span>
the nests of this species; sometimes in the nest
proper, and again placed around the sides of it, in
all probability for protective purposes, and changed
and rearranged from time to time&rdquo; ... probably
hung outside to &ldquo;alarm intruders.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_128" href="#fn_128">[128]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Crested Flycatcher lives in eastern North America;
breeds from southern Canada to Florida, and
winters in Mexico and northern South America. He is a
common summer resident of the Middle and Southern
States especially. Though louder-voiced than his relatives,
the kingbird, ph&oelig;be, and wood pewee, he is not so
well known because he is shyer. He is not so pugnacious
as the kingbird, but he is known to fight fiercely for a
mate.</p>
<h2>THE OLIVE-SIDED FLYCATCHER
<br /><i>Flycatcher Family&mdash;Tyrannid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 7&frac12; inches.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: Upper parts <i>and sides olive-gray</i>, the gray
extending across the breast; throat and belly yellowish,
the yellow extending in a point almost to the
center of the breast; a patch of whitish feathers on
both sides of the back near the rump; head slightly
crested; bill long, black above, yellow below, bristles
at the base, wings and tail olive-brown.</p>
<p><b>Notes</b>: A monotonous call-note, <i>Pit-pit-pit</i>, and a loud, clear
<i>Peep-here</i> or <i>Peep-peep-here</i>, frequently uttered from
the top of a tall spruce.</p>

<h2>THE WOOD PEWEE
<br /><i>Flycatcher Family&mdash;Tyrannid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: From 6 to 6&frac12; inches.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: Dark olive-gray above, darkest on the head,
which is somewhat crested; the slightly hooked bill
has bristles at its base; under parts, grayish-white,
slightly tinged with yellow; breast and sides a
darker gray; brownish wings and tail; two whitish
wing-bars that are more conspicuous than those of
the ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p><b>Notes</b>: <i>Pee-a-wee</i>, uttered slowly and mournfully, yet with
sweetness and tenderness. Sometimes the phrase is
followed by an abrupt <i>Peer</i>, given with a falling inflection.
At times pewees sing continuously. My
sister timed one that sang for an hour and twenty
minutes at daybreak.</p>
<p><b>Nest</b>: One of the most beautiful made. It is rather broad and
flat, decorated on the outside with lichens similarly
to that of the hummingbird. The nest seems to grow
out of the branch on which it is placed.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: North and South America. Breeds from southern
Canada to southern Texas and central Florida, westward
to eastern Nebraska; winters from Nicaraugua
to Colombia and Peru.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of all the flycatchers of my acquaintance the Wood
Pewee is the most lovable. He is the only one
that possesses a sweet voice; but his note, long-drawn and
sad, seems to proceed from an over-burdened heart. The
appearance of the little bird is dejected, as with drooping
tail, he utters the plaintive sound.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig51">
<img src="images/i365.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="723" />
<p class="caption">WOOD PEWEE</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>The nature of the pewee is sweet and trustful. I have
always found him responsive, replying almost invariably
as I have imitated his note. I once had a particularly
pleasant experience and succeeded in convincing a little
pewee of my friendly attitude toward him. One summer
I was obliged to spend many weary days in a hammock
hung in a grove; I beguiled the tedious hours by endeavoring
to attract birds to close proximity. A pewee came
oftenest; he frequently perched on a bough within a few
feet of my hammock, and &ldquo;talked back&rdquo; to me between
dives after insects. That he knew me and was unafraid
was proved, for when relatives and friends arrived later
in the summer, he would fly away at their approach.</p>
<p>I saw much of him, even when parental responsibilities
claimed him. One day, after the young had flown, I
came upon him calling earnestly, evidently to a fledgling
that was on the ground at my feet. I picked up the little
thing; it cuddled down in my warm hand and closed its
eyes. Its father continued to call, but without excitement
at such a proceeding; he seemed to know that I would not
hurt his baby. I put it on a bough near him and left
them to work out their bird-problems together.</p>
<p>Not many days later, we saw four young pewees
perched in a row on a wire near the house, with their
parents in attendance. The father called repeatedly and
the little ones made sweet inarticulate gurglings, finding
their voices. They were as dear a bird-family as it has
ever been my pleasure to see.</p>
<p class="tb">Dallas Lore Sharp, in his delightful essay, &ldquo;A Palace
in a Pig-pen,&rdquo; thus summarizes the flycatchers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much can be said of this flycatcher family, except
<span class="pb" id="Page_244">244</span>
that it is useful&mdash;a kind of virtue that gets its chief reward
in heaven. I am acquainted with only four of the
other nine eastern members, [besides the ph&oelig;be], the
great crested flycatcher, kingbird, wood pewee, and
chebec,&mdash;and each of these has some redeeming attribute
besides the habit of catching flies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are all good nest-builders, good parents, and
brave, independent birds; but aside from ph&oelig;be and
pewee&mdash;the latter in his small way the sweetest voice
of the oak woods&mdash;the whole family is an odd lot, cross-grained,
cross-looking, and about as musical as a family
of ducks. A duck seems to know that he cannot sing.
A flycatcher knows nothing of his shortcomings. He believes
that he can sing, and in time he will prove it.
If desire and effort count for anything, he certainly must
prove it in time. How long the family has already been
training no one knows. Everybody knows, however, the
success each flycatcher of them has thus far attained.
It would make a good minstrel show, doubtless, if the
family would appear together. In chorus, surely, they
would be far from a tuneful choir. Yet individually,
in the wide universal chorus of the out-of-doors, how
much we should miss the kingbird&rsquo;s metallic twitter and
the chebec&rsquo;s insistent call!&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_129" href="#fn_129">[129]</a></p>

<h2>THE RUBY-CROWNED KINGLET
<br /><i>Old World Warbler Family&mdash;Sylviid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: A little over 4&frac14; inches.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Olive-green above, buff underneath, <i>a ruby-red crown</i>;
wings brown, edged with olive-green; two light wing-bars;
tail brown, forked.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Similar to male, but lacking the red crown. The females
resemble tiny warblers in appearance.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: A sharp scolding-note.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A wonderful song,&mdash;full, loud, and indescribably beautiful.
It is hard to believe that so finished and remarkable
a song could come from so small a bird.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Woods, thickets, and orchards. Kinglets are usually
seen near the ends of branches.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Northern North America. Breeds in the tree-regions
of southern Canada, southern Alaska, and the higher
mountains of the western United States.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like many of the warblers, the Ruby-crowned Kinglet
is a spring and fall migrant, and its arrival
is therefore of especial interest. It excels most of the
warblers in its power of song, and is even more agile
than they.</p>
<p>In Bulletin 513 of the Biological Survey is the following
description of the Ruby-crown: &ldquo;In habits and
haunts this tiny sprite resembles a chickadee. It is an
active, nervous little creature, flitting hither and yon in
search of food, and in spring stopping only long enough
to utter its beautiful song, surprisingly loud for the size
of the musician. Three-fourths of its food consists of
<span class="pb" id="Page_246">246</span>
wasps, bugs, and flies. Beetles are the only other item
of importance. The bugs eaten by the kinglet are mostly
small, but, happily, they are the most harmful kinds.
Treehoppers, leafhoppers, and jumping plant-lice are
pests and often do great harm to trees and smaller plants,
while plant-lice and scale insects are the worst scourges
of the fruit-grower&mdash;in fact, the prevalence of the latter
has almost risen to the magnitude of a national peril.
It is these small and seemingly insignificant birds that
most successfully attack and hold in check these insidious
foes of horticulture. The vegetable food consists of seeds
of poison ivy, or poison oak, a few weed seeds, and a few
small fruits, mostly elderberries.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>THE BLUE-GRAY GNATCATCHER
<br /><i>Old World Warbler Family&mdash;Sylviid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 4&frac12; inches.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Bluish-gray above; grayish white below; forehead black,
black line over the eye; slender, curving bill; wings
dark gray, edged with grayish-white; tail long, outer
tail-feathers nearly all white; middle tail-feathers
black; tail elevated and lowered frequently.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Similar to male, but without the black forehead; line
over eye indistinct.</p>
<p><b>Call-note</b>: A nasal <i>tang</i>.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A delightful song,&mdash;sweet, but not strong.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Woodlands, where it usually frequents treetops.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Southeastern United States. Breeds from eastern Nebraska,
southern Wisconsin, Michigan, and Ontario,
southwestern Pennsylvania, Maryland, and southern
New Jersey to southern Texas and central Florida;
<span class="pb" id="Page_247">247</span>
winters from northern Florida to the West Indies and
central America; casual in Minnesota, New England,
and New York.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This dainty little sprite partakes of the qualities of
a number of birds. Like the warblers, it is insectivorous
and inhabits treetops; like its relative, the
ruby-crowned kinglet, it has a finished and wonderful
song; like the wrens it has a habit of cocking its tail nervously;
while its long black and white tail reminds one of
the mockingbird. It is an especially pretty sight, fluttering
about the moss-hung trees of Florida.</p>

<h2>THE RED-EYED VIREO
<br /><i>Vireo Family&mdash;Vireonid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 6&frac14; inches.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: Olive-green above, silvery white below;
<i>crown gray, bordered with a narrow black line; a
broader white line over the eye, a dark streak through
the eye; iris red</i> or <i>reddish-brown</i>; wings and tail
grayish-green, edged with olive.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: In open woodlands and along well-shaded roads.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: North and South America. Breeds from central
Canada, northwestern, central, and eastern United
States, to central Florida; winters in South America.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: A nasal <i>wh&#259;h</i>, that sounds ill-natured and unpleasant.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A series of phrases&mdash;incessant, monotonous,&mdash;that continue
from morning until night, and during August,
when most birds are quiet. Wilson Flagg called
the Red-eye the &ldquo;Preacher-bird&rdquo; and wrote of him
as follows:</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;The Preacher is more generally known by his
note, because he is incessant in his song, and particularly
vocal during the heat of our long summer
days, when only a few birds are singing. His style
of preaching is not declamation. Though constantly
talking, he takes the part of a deliberative orator,
who explains his subject in a few words and then
makes a pause for his hearers to reflect upon it.
We might suppose him to be repeating moderately,
with a pause between each sentence, &lsquo;You see it&mdash;you
know it&mdash;do you hear me?&mdash;do you believe it?&rsquo;
All these strains are delivered with a rising inflection
at the close, and with a pause, as if waiting for an
answer.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig52">
<img src="images/i373.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="727" />
<p class="caption">RED-EYED VIREO</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;He is never fervent, rapid, or fluent, but like a
true zealot, he is apt to be tiresome from the long
continuance of his discourse. When nearly all other
birds have become silent, the little preacher still
continues his earnest harangue, and is sure of an
audience at this late period, when he has few
rivals.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_130" href="#fn_130">[130]</a></p>
<p class="bq">Mr. Forbush discovered that this preacher &ldquo;practiced
as he preached,&rdquo; and tells us of his own observations
in the following words:</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;One sunny day in early boyhood I watched a
vireo singing in a swampy thicket. He sang a few
notes, his head turning meanwhile from side to side,
his eyes scanning closely the nearby foliage. Suddenly
his song ceased; he leaned forward,&mdash;sprang
to another twig, snatched a green caterpillar from the
under side of a leaf, swallowed it, and resumed his
song. Every important pause in his dissertation
signalized the capture of a larva. As the discourse
was punctuated, a worm was punctured. It seems as
if the preaching were a serious business with the
bird; but this seeming is deceptive, for the song
merely masks the constant vigilance and the sleepless
eye of this premium caterpillar-hunter. In the
discovery of this kind of game the bird has few
superiors.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_131" href="#fn_131">[131]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This vireo builds a very attractive nest of strips of
bark and fiber, a soft basket hung at the fork of a
branch. I recall one nest suspended only a few feet from
the ground in a low tree on Cape Cod. We came upon
the nest so suddenly that the little brooding mother looked
<span class="pb" id="Page_250">250</span>
at us with frightened eyes, but she remained at her post,
and soon learned that we meant no harm. Many times
a day we went by her precious cradle. At night we
passed quietly, so as not to waken the faithful little
mother-bird with her head tucked under her wing. Our
flashlight never once disturbed her. Mr. Forbush says,
&ldquo;This vireo sleeps very soundly, and is sometimes so oblivious
to the world that she may be approached and taken
in the hand.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_132" href="#fn_132">[132]</a></p>
<p>Burroughs wrote: &ldquo;Who does not feel a thrill of
pleasure when, in sauntering through the woods, his hat
just brushes a vireo&rsquo;s nest?... The nest was like a
natural growth, hanging there like a fairy basket in the
fork of a beech twig, woven of dry, delicate, papery,
brown and gray wood products,&mdash;a part of the shadows
and the green and brown solitude. The weaver had bent
down one of the green leaves and made it a part of the
nest; it was like the stroke of a great artist. Then the
dabs of white here and there, given by the fragments of
spider&rsquo;s cocoons&mdash;all helped to blend it with the flickering
light and shade.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_133" href="#fn_133">[133]</a></p>
<h2>THE WARBLING VIREO
<br /><i>Vireo Family&mdash;Vireonid&aelig;</i></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 5&frac34; inches.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: Grayish-olive above; <i>indistinct whitish
line over eye</i>; under parts grayish-white with a faint
yellowish tinge; <i>no bars on wings; iris dark brown</i>,
not reddish.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: A nasal <i>y&#259;h</i>, not unlike the call-note of the red-eyed
vireo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p><b>Song</b>: A sweet continuous warble, with a rising inflection at
the end. It sounds like a whistled <i>Whew-whew-whew
whew-whew-whew-whee?</i></p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Parks and shaded village streets. Its neutral coloring
and its preference for treetops make it difficult
to distinguish. Its cheerful, pleasant song is the
surest means of identification.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern North America. Breeds from south-central
Canada to northwestern Texas, southern Louisiana,
North Carolina, and Virginia; winters south of the
United States, though exact locality is unknown.
Not nearly so widely distributed as the red-eyed vireo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This vireo, like other members of its family, is an
indefatigable devourer of insects. Mr. Forbush
reports that it feeds on flies, mosquitoes, and grasshoppers,
but that its chief food consists of caterpillars and other
leaf-eating insects, especially the elm-leaf beetle; consequently
it is found frequently in elm-shaded streets and
yards.</p>
<h2>THE WHITE-EYED VIREO
<br /><i>Vireo Family&mdash;Vireonid&aelig;</i></h2>
<p>The White-Eyed Vireo differs from his red-eyed
cousin in being slightly smaller, in having a <i>small
patch of yellow around the eye</i>, a <i>white iris</i>, and <i>two
wing-bars</i>. His head is greener and his breast and sides
are tinged with yellow.</p>
<p>He lives in thickets. He possesses in a marked degree
the vireo habit of scolding. He has more power as a
songster than his better-known relatives. Mr. Chapman
<span class="pb" id="Page_252">252</span>
describes him most delightfully as follows: &ldquo;If birds
are ever impertinent, I believe this term might with truth
be applied to that most original, independent dweller in
thickety under-growths, the white-eyed vireo. Both his
voice and manner say that he doesn&rsquo;t in the least care
what you think of him; and, if attracted by his peculiar
notes or actions, you pause near his haunts, he jerks out
an abrupt &lsquo;Who are you, eh?&rsquo; in a way which plainly indicates
that your presence can be dispensed with. If this
hint is insufficient, he follows it by a harsh scolding, and
one can fancy that in his singular white eye there is an
unmistakable gleam of disapproval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have always regretted that the manners of this Vireo
have been a bar to our better acquaintance, for he is a
bird of marked character and with unusual vocal talents.
He is a capital mimic, and in the retirement of his home
sometimes amuses himself by combining the songs of
other birds in an intricate pot-pourri.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_134" href="#fn_134">[134]</a></p>
<h2>THE YELLOW-THROATED VIREO
<br /><i>Vireo Family&mdash;Vireonid&aelig;</i></h2>
<p>The Yellow-throated Vireo resembles the White-eye
in being olive-green above, yellowish underneath,
and in having two distinct white wing-bars. He differs in
possessing a <i>bright yellow throat</i>, <i>breast</i>, and <i>ring</i> about
a <i>dark eye</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Forbush says of this bird; &ldquo;The song is a little
louder than that of most vireos, and may be easily distinguished
<span class="pb" id="Page_253">253</span>
from all others. It usually consists of two or
three rich and virile notes, uttered interrogatively or tentatively,
followed immediately by a few similar tones uttered
decisively. The bird appears to ask a question,
and then answer it. Its alarm notes are as harsh as those
of an oriole, and somewhat similar in quality.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_135" href="#fn_135">[135]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<h2>THE WARBLERS
<br /><i>Warbler Family&mdash;Mniotiltid&aelig;</i></h2>
<p>No family of birds is more difficult for a beginner
to identify than the warblers. Reasons for this
fact are various. In the first place, warblers are small
and agile, and usually inhabit treetops, where it is hard
to see their plumage. The number of the species is large,&mdash;155
species are known, 74 of which are found in North
America, and 55 in the United States alone. Some of
the males wear a &ldquo;Joseph&rsquo;s coat of many colors&rdquo;; some
of the females are so different from their mates as to
puzzle an observer, and the young birds frequently differ
from both parents. Then, too, most warblers are not
gifted songsters, but utter only a weak trill. A number
of them are seen only during their migration to northern
woods; they linger too short a time to become more than
passing bird-acquaintances.</p>
<p>Warblers are insectivorous and do not arrive until the
earth teems with insect life. Most of them depart for
the South as soon as insects begin to decrease in number
or disappear. They are very shy and migrate at night.</p>
<p>Many are the disasters that befall them when they
journey near the sea-coast. In Dr. Wells W. Cooke&rsquo;s article
entitled &ldquo;Our Greatest Travelers&rdquo; are the following
statements: &ldquo;It is not to be supposed that these long
flights over the waters can occur without many casualties,
and not the smallest of the perils arises from the beacons
<span class="pb" id="Page_255">255</span>
which man has erected along the coast to insure his own
safety. &lsquo;Last night I could have filled a mail-sack with
the bodies of little warblers which killed themselves striking
against my light,&rsquo; wrote the keeper of Fowey Rocks
lighthouse, in southern Florida.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor was this an unusual tragedy. Every spring the
lights along the coast lure to destruction myriads of birds
who are en route from their winter homes in the South
to their summer nesting-places in the North. Every fall
a still greater death-toll is exacted when the return journey
is made. A red light or a rapidly flashing one repels the
birds, but a steady white light piercing the fog proves irresistible.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_136" href="#fn_136">[136]</a></p>
<p>Few people realize the great good done by warblers.
Mr. Forbush says that in migration they seem to possess
enormous appetites. A Hooded Warbler was found to
catch on the average two insects a minute or one hundred
and twenty an hour. At this rate the bird would kill at
least nine hundred and sixty insects a day, in an eight
hour working day!</p>
<p>Dr. Judd reported a Palm Warbler that ate from forty
to sixty insects a minute. In the four hours he was under
observation he must have eaten nine thousand, five hundred
insects. Mr. Forbush says that he has seen warblers
eating from masses of small insects at such a rate that it
was impossible for him to count them.<a class="fn" id="fr_137" href="#fn_137">[137]</a></p>

<h3>IDENTIFICATION OF WARBLERS</h3>
<p>In order to identify warblers, most people need to

<h2>GROUP ONE&mdash;THE GROUND WARBLERS</h2>
<h2>1. THE OVEN-BIRD</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: A little over 6 inches.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: Olive-brown above; head with a golden-brown
crown, bordered with two black lines that extend
from bill to neck; under parts white; a brown
streak at each side of the throat; breast and sides
heavily streaked with black; no bars on wings, or
patches on tail.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Mr. Forbush interprets the oven-bird&rsquo;s note as &ldquo;<i>chick</i>,&prime;
<span class="small">KERCHICK</span>,&prime; KERCHICK,&prime; repeating the phrase an
indefinite number of times.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_138" href="#fn_138">[138]</a> John Burroughs has
rendered it as, &ldquo;teacher, <i>teacher</i>, teacher, TEACHER,
<i>TEACHER</i>.&rdquo; The bird is frequently spoken of as
the &ldquo;Teacher-bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A &ldquo;flight song&rdquo; which Mr. Forbush describes as follows:
&ldquo;When I lingered in the woods at evening
until the stars came out, I heard a burst of melody
far above the treetops, and saw the little singer
rising against the western sky, simulating the Skylark,
and pouring forth its melody, not to the orb of
day but to the slowly rising moon; then, when the
melody came nearer, the exhausted singer fell from
out the sky and shot swiftly downward, alighting at
my very feet.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fn_138">[138]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Woodlands, where the oven-bird spends much of its
time on the ground.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: North America. Breeds in the forests of Canada and
the United States to Kansas, southern Missouri, Ohio
Valley, Virginia, and in the mountains of Georgia
and South Carolina; winters from central Florida
to Colombia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This shy forest-dweller is little seen except by the
tireless haunter of woods. I well remember my
first quest for the owner of a voice that seemed to proceed
from every part of the small grove I was searching. His
ventriloquistic power led me on until I was about to give
up in weariness and discouragement, when suddenly I
came upon this golden-crowned warbler that had made
the woods ring. He seemed very small for so loud a
vocalization.</p>
<p>Another day, quite by accident, I discovered his oven-shaped
nest:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Arched and framed with last year&rsquo;s oak-leaves,</p>
<p class="t0">Roofed and walled against the raindrops.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_139" href="#fn_139">[139]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Since that time I have had numerous views of oven-birds.
One in particular, seemed quite unafraid; and
several times approached within a few feet of where I
was seated.</p>
<h2>2. THE WATER-THRUSHES</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Water-Thrushes</b>: The Water-thrushes resemble the oven-bird
in size and general appearance. Their crowns
are dark instead of golden; the <span class="small">NORTHERN WATER-THRUSH</span>
has a <i>light</i> line over the eye, and a bright
yellow streaked breast; the <span class="small">LOUISIANA WATER-THRUSH</span>
a conspicuous <i>white</i> line over the eye, buff sides, and
white under parts.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig53">
<img src="images/i385.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="726" />
<p class="caption">OVEN-BIRD</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p class="bq">Both birds, as their name implies, love the vicinity
of forest brooks. Both walk instead of hop,
and &ldquo;<i>tip-up</i>&rdquo; when they alight. They are wonderful
songsters, but are not widely known.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern North America. The Northern Water-thrush
breeds in east-central Canada, northwestern New
York, northern New England, and in mountains
south to West Virginia; winters in the West Indies
and from the valley of Mexico to British Guiana.</p>
<p class="bq">The Louisiana Water-thrush is found from the
northern parts of the United States south to Texas,
Georgia, and South Carolina; winters from Mexico
to Colombia.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>3. THE WORM-EATING WARBLER</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 5&frac12; inches.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: Back, wings, and tail olive-green, without
white markings; head with two narrow and two
broad black stripes, alternating with three cream-colored
stripes; under parts cream-colored, lighter
on throat and belly.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A weak trill.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: &ldquo;The Worm-eating warbler seems to prefer dense
undergrowth in swampy thickets and wet places,
... wooded hillsides and ravines, and dense undergrowths
of woodland.... The nesting site is
on the ground.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_140" href="#fn_140">[140]</a></p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern North America from southern Iowa, northern
Illinois, western Pennsylvania, and the lower Hudson
and Connecticut valleys, south to Missouri, Tennessee,
Virginia, and the mountains of South Carolina.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<h2>GROUP TWO&mdash;THE BLACK AND WHITE WARBLERS</h2>
<h2>1. THE BLACK-AND-WHITE WARBLER</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 5&frac14; inches.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Black, streaked with white&mdash;<i>no yellow</i>; head with broad
black and white stripes; body with narrow stripes;
white stripe over eye, black patch back of eye; striped
throat and sides, white belly; tail grayish black;
outer tail-feathers with white patches on inner web;
wings black, with two distinct white bars.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Similar, but with gray cheeks and whiter under parts,
fainter streaks, and brownish sides.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A thin, unmusical <i>se-se&prime;-se-se&prime;-se-se&prime;-se-se&prime;</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="bq">This Black-and-White Warbler is as easy to identify
as a zebra, because of its conspicuous black and
white stripes. As it is found on tree-trunks, it is sometimes
confused with the brown creeper. Its bill, however,
is not curved like the creeper&rsquo;s, nor is its tail used as a
prop. It resembles the nuthatch in its ability to <i>descend</i>
as well as <i>ascend</i> tree-trunks.</p>
<p class="bq">These warblers, though they obtain their food from
trees, nest on the ground in nests not unlike those of the
oven-bird.</p>
<h2>2. THE BLACK-POLL WARBLER</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 5 inches.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: A black crown and white cheeks, giving the effect of a
black cap pulled down over the eyes; throat and
belly white; back and sides gray, streaked with
black; two white wing-bars; two outer tail-feathers
with white spot near tip.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p><b>Female</b>: Olive-green above, streaked with black; breast and
sides with yellowish wash.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Widely distributed; common in the East during migration.
Breeds in the forests of Alaska and north-central
Canada, in Michigan, northern Maine, and
the mountains of New Hampshire and Vermont.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Black-poll Warblers are similar in coloring
to the black-and-white warblers, but are duller and
less striking in appearance. In the breeding season,
father, mother, and young differ in plumage, though a
practiced eye may see resemblances, but in the fall they
don coats so similar that they seem to have adopted a
family costume.</p>
<p>The migration of black-poll warblers is interesting.
Dr. Wells W. Cooke says: &ldquo;All black-poll warblers winter
in South America. Those that are to nest in Alaska
strike straight across the Caribbean Sea to Florida and go
northwestward to the Mississippi River. Then the direction
changes and a course is laid almost due north to northern
Minnesota, in order to avoid the treeless plains of North
Dakota. But when the forests of the Saskatchewan are
reached, the northwestern course is resumed, and, with a
slight verging toward the west, is held until the nesting
site in Alaska spruces is attained.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_141" href="#fn_141">[141]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<h2>GROUP THREE&mdash;THE BLACK, WHITE, AND YELLOW WARBLERS</h2>
<h2>1. THE MYRTLE WARBLER
<br />OR
<br />YELLOW-RUMPED WARBLER</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: A little over 5&frac12; inches, one of the larger warblers.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: The grayish upper parts, white under parts, (both
streaked with black), and the black cheeks of the
Myrtle Warbler remind one of the Black and White
Creeping Warbler. Its <i>four patches of yellow</i>,&mdash;on
the <i>crown</i>, <i>rump</i>, and on <i>each side</i> are distinctive.
The wings and tail are brownish-gray; wings, with
<i>two white bars</i>; tail with graduated patches of white
<i>near end</i> of outside feathers; white throat and belly.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Browner above; breast less heavily streaked with
black.</p>
<p><b>Notes</b>: The notes and song of this warbler are described by
Mr. Forbush as follows: &ldquo;The Myrtle Warbler has
a variety of notes, but the one usually uttered spring
and fall is a soft chirp or <i>chup</i>, which, at a little distance,
exactly resembles the sound produced by a
large drop of water as it strikes the ground or leaf-mold.
These sounds are so similar that after
storms in the woods I have often found it difficult to
distinguish the note of this warbler from the splash
of the large drops that were still falling from the
trees. The song is a rather weak warble, very
sweet, and often of long duration.... It has quite
as many variations as the song of any warbler that I
now recall.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_142" href="#fn_142">[142]</a></p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Breeds in the forest-belt of Canada and Alaska, south
to Minnesota, Michigan, New Hampshire, Maine,
<span class="pb" id="Page_263">263</span>
Vermont, Massachusetts, and the mountains of New
York, winters from Kansas, New Jersey, southern
New England to West Indies, Mexico, and Panama,
and from central Oregon to southern California.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Myrtle or Yellow-rumped Warbler is found in
North America except in the western United States.
It is so abundant and so distinctly marked as to be better
known than many warblers. &ldquo;Trim of form and graceful
of motion, when seeking its food it combines the
methods of the wrens, creepers, and flycatchers. This bird
is so small and nimble that it successfully attacks insects
too minute to be prey for larger birds. Flies are the
largest item of food; in fact only a few flycatchers and
swallows eat as many flies as this bird.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_143" href="#fn_143">[143]</a></p>
<p>The Myrtle Warbler is especially fond of bayberries
and may be found, even in winter, where these berries
are to be obtained. New Jersey and Cape Cod are favorite
feeding places.</p>
<h2>2. THE MAGNOLIA WARBLER</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 5 inches.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Smaller than the Myrtle Warbler, and at first glance,
not unlike it in appearance, because each bird has a
yellow rump, a striped breast, dark gray upper parts,
and back and breast streaked with black. The head
of the Magnolia Warbler, however, has <i>no yellow
patch</i>, but a <i>broad white line over the eye</i>, black
cheeks and forehead, and <i>yellow</i> under parts, (instead
of white), which are heavily streaked with black.
The wings have <i>large white patches</i> instead of <i>bars</i>;
the tail is black, with a broad white band extending
<i>across</i> the <i>middle</i>,&mdash;a distinguishing mark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p><b>Female</b>: Similar to male, but duller.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: &ldquo;It is one of our full-voiced warblers, the song resembling
the syllables wee-to, <i>wee-to, wee-a-tee or witchi,
witchi, witchi, tit, witchi-tit, witchi-tit, witchi-tit</i>,
the first four words deliberate and even, the last three
hurried and higher pitched.... The song is louder
than the yellow warbler&rsquo;s.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_144" href="#fn_144">[144]</a></p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: &ldquo;Throughout the migration season, the Magnolia
warbler is common throughout our orchards and
shade trees, as well as woodlands.... In its nesting
grounds, this warbler prefers coniferous growth,
especially young spruces.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fn_144">[144]</a></p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Breeds from southern Mackenzie, Keewatin, northern
Quebec, and Newfoundland to central Alberta, Saskatchewan,
Minnesota, northern Michigan, and northern
Massachusetts; in the mountains of West Virginia,
Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York; winters
from southern Mexico to Panama.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. C. F. Stone in &ldquo;Birds of New York&rdquo; says:
&ldquo;Every hemlock-clad gully or hemlock woods
where the trees are close and limbs intertwined afford
suitable haunts for this lively and emphatic singer....
Among the smaller gullies 1 or 2 pairs may be found, and
in the larger gullies it is not unusual to locate 12 or 15
pairs during the nesting period. In some of these situations
the Magnolia does not seem to occur, perhaps because
it is so persecuted by red squirrels and cowbirds.
The latter seems to make a specialty of presenting
this warbler with one or more of its eggs, generally
puncturing the eggs of the Magnolia before leaving the
nest.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fn_144">[144]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<h2>GROUP FOUR&mdash;THE BLACK AND ORANGE WARBLERS</h2>
<h2>1. THE REDSTART</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 5&frac12; inches.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Body glossy black, with a white belly, orange patches
at the sides of the body and under the wings; an orange
band across the wings; middle tail-feathers
black; other tail-feathers broadly tipped with black
but largely orange, conspicuous in flight; bill with
bristles.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Gray and olive-green above, white underneath; yellow
instead of orange on sides, wings, tail, and under tail.</p>
<p><b>Young Male</b>: Like female till end of first breeding season.</p>
<p><b>Nest</b>: A beautiful structure made of strips of bark, root-fibers,
and plant-down, and placed in the fork of a tree.
If built in a birch sapling and decorated with bits of
birch bark, it seems a part of the tree.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A cheerful trill, rather weak and unmusical.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: North America. Breeds from Oklahoma, Arkansas,
and North Carolina northward; winters in the West
Indies, central Mexico, and northern South America.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Redstart is one of the most beautiful and conspicuous
of the warblers. Its fan-shaped, flame-colored
tail tipped with black is its most distinctive mark.
It is in almost constant motion, fluttering incessantly in
pursuit of its insect prey. Mr. Forbush writes, &ldquo;In all
its movements its wings are held in readiness for instant
flight, and in its sinuous twistings and turnings, risings
and fallings, its colors expand, contract, and glow amid
the sylvan shades like a dancing torch.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_145" href="#fn_145">[145]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>Like flycatchers, the redstart has bristles at the base of
its bill, which makes the capture of a great variety of insects
an easy matter. It has been named the &ldquo;flycatcher
of the inner treetops, but it is a flycatcher of the bushtops
as well.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_146" href="#fn_146">[146]</a></p>
<h2>2. THE BLACKBURNIAN WARBLER</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: A little over 5 inches.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Black crown, with bright orange patch in the center; irregular
black patch extending from eye, bordered
with orange; throat and breast orange, becoming
yellowish on belly; back black, streaked with white;
sides streaked with black; wings black, with white
edges and a <i>large white patch</i>; tail black, <i>most of the
feathers nearly all white on inner web</i>. Colors
duller in the fall.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Upper parts grayish-olive, streaked with white;
orange parts paler, less white on wings and tail.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A &ldquo;thin&rdquo; warbler-like trill.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Treetops of coniferous forests preferably.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Breeds from central Canada to northern United States,
and in the Alleghany Mts. from Pennsylvania to
Georgia; winters in Colombia and Peru.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This brilliant warbler flashes flame as do the oriole
and the redstart, and like them, always brings a
thrill of pleasure. It remains with us so short a time
that its appearance is an event.</p>
<p>Mr. Forbush tells of going out at daybreak May 11,
1900, at Amesbury, Mass., to observe the migrant
warblers. He says: &ldquo;As we walked through the streets
<span class="pb" id="Page_267">267</span>
of the village, many male Blackburnian Warblers were
seen among the street trees. A little later we saw them
in the orchards, their brilliant orange breasts flashing in
the sunlight. As we approached the woods it was everywhere
the same. The night had been very cold, and other
insect-eating birds were seeking benumbed insects on or
near the ground. There were four bright Redstarts flitting
about on the upturned sod of a newly plowed garden.
These and other species of Warblers were to be seen in
every orchard, wood, and thicket. The Blackburnian
Warblers had come in during the night, and were busy
hunting for their breakfasts until 7 o&rsquo;clock, when we went
to ours. At 8 o&rsquo;clock not a single Blackburnian was to
be seen. I scoured the country till nearly noon, finding
all the other Warblers as at daybreak, but not a Blackburnian
could be found. They had done their share of
the good work and passed on. A later riser would have
missed them.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_147" href="#fn_147">[147]</a></p>
<p>Eaton says: &ldquo;The Blackburnian warbler during the
migration season associates with the Magnolia, Bay-breasted,
and Chestnut-sided warblers among the blossoming
fruit trees and the leaving shrubbery and shade trees
of our lawns and parks. During the nesting season, however,
it is almost entirely confined to mixed and evergreen
forests, being especially fond of hemlocks and spruces....
The old name of Hemlock warbler is perfectly appropriate.
The Blackburnian flutters about while feeding
almost as conspicuously as the Redstart and Magnolia,
displaying its brilliant colors and pied pattern very effectively.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_148" href="#fn_148">[148]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<h2>GROUP FIVE&mdash;THE YELLOW AND OLIVE-GREEN WARBLERS</h2>
<h2>1. THE YELLOW WARBLER, OR SUMMER YELLOW-BIRD</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 5 inches.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Olive-green above, bright yellow below; <i>breast streaked
with brown</i>; wings edged with yellow; tail dark
brown, with yellow on inner web; <i>no black on head,
throat, wings</i>, or <i>tail</i>; bill slender.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Similar; with fainter streaks on breast, or an unstreaked
breast.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A sweet <i>chee-chee-chee-chee-chee&prime;-a-wee?</i></p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Orchards, gardens, and shade trees, rather than
woods.</p>
<p><b>Nest</b>: A beautiful cup lined with felt. This bird&rsquo;s nest has
been recorded as a favorite depository for cowbirds&rsquo;
eggs.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: North America. Breeds from northern Canadian
and Alaskan tree-regions to southern Missouri and
northern South Carolina; winters from Yucatan to
Brazil and Peru.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Yellow Warbler is one of the best known of its
tribe. It is an attractive, lovable little bird, a useful
destroyer of small insects that feed upon the leaves
of trees, and a charming addition to any orchard or garden,
as it flits among the trees like a ray of sunshine.</p>
<p>It is frequently confused with the goldfinch; but careful
observation of markings, of flight, and of song will show
decided differences. The goldfinch has a black crown,
wings, and tail, an unstreaked breast, undulating flight,
and a sustained song. This little olive and yellow bird
has no black in its plumage; it makes short flights, and
sings a simple strain. It is not a seed-eater, like the
finches, but is insectivorous.</p>

<h2>2. THE PINE WARBLER</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 5&frac12; inches.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Upper parts olive-green with a grayish tinge; throat and
breast yellow; sides streaked with gray; belly white;
wings and tail brownish-gray; wings with two whitish
bars; <i>outer tail-feathers tipped with white on
inner web</i>.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Similar to male, but browner above and duller underneath.</p>
<p><b>Notes</b>: &ldquo;Its alarm note is a sharp chirp, its other notes are few
and weak.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: &ldquo;The song is one of the most soothing sounds of the
pine-woods. It has in it the same dreamy drowsiness
that characterizes the note of the Black-throated
Green Warbler, but is otherwise entirely different in
tone and quality, being composed of a series of
short, soft, whistling notes, run together in a continuous
trill. It resembles, in a way, the song of the
Chipping Sparrow, except that it is softer and more
musical.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_149" href="#fn_149">[149]</a></p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: &ldquo;Pine woods and groves; it seems to prefer the pitch
pines, and is one of the few birds that habitually live
and breed in woods of this character, like those of
Cape Cod. It has been called the Pine-creeping
Warbler, from its habit of creeping along the
branches, and occasionally up and around the trunks
of pines.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fn_149">[149]</a></p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern North America. It is abundant in the South
where pine forests are common. It is found in
<span class="pb" id="Page_270">270</span>
southern Canada, northern and eastern United States,
in such pine-regions as Michigan and New Jersey.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>3. THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 5&frac14; inches.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Olive-green above, brightest on rump and tail; yellow
underneath, with gray sides; <i>a broad band of black
bordered at the back with gray extends across the

the conspicuous mask.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Similar to male, but without a mask.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: A sharp call-note chick, frequently repeated.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: <i>Witch&prime;-e-tee&prime;-o, witch&prime;-e-tee&prime;-o.</i> Writers interpret the
song in various ways. Mr. Forbush&rsquo;s <i>sich&prime;-a-wiggle,
sich&prime;-a-wiggle, sich&prime;-a-wiggle</i>, is an excellent rendering.
The song varies with individuals, but is phrased
and accented similarly.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Roadside thickets, especially near water.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern North America. It breeds from North Dakota
eastward to southeastern Canada, and south to
central Texas, the northern part of the Gulf States
and Virginia; winters from North Carolina and
Louisiana to Florida, the Bahamas, Cuba, Guatemala,
and Costa Rica.</p>

<p>The Maryland Yellow-throat is a delightful summer
visitor. Trim, dainty, exquisitely colored,
lithe, and full of song, he is a charming part of the thickets
of roadsides and streams.</p>

<h2>4. THE HOODED WARBLER</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 5&frac12; inches.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Forehead, cheeks, breast, and belly yellow; <i>back</i> of
<i>crown</i> and <i>throat black</i>, the two dark areas <i>united
by a black line</i>; <i>mask yellow</i>; back and rump olive;
wings and tail a dark grayish-olive; the <i>outer tail-feathers
largely white</i> on their <i>inner webs</i>.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Similar to male, but without the black hood; dark
edge to crown; breast faintly washed with black.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: E. H. Eaton in his &ldquo;<i>Birds of New York</i>&rdquo; writes: &ldquo;The
song of this warbler is one of the few which the author
can hear with perfect distinctness and enjoy.&rdquo;
He adds that it is described by Langille as follows:
&ldquo;<i>che-reek, che-reek, che-reek, chi-de-ee</i>, the first three
with a loud, bell-like ring, the rest much accelerated
with a falling inflection.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Trees of deep woods.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern United States, west to the Plains, north and
east to southern Michigan and Ontario, western and
southeastern New York, and southern New England;
in winter, West Indies, eastern Mexico, Central
America, and Panama.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<p>This warbler looks as though it had nearly divided
a large hood,&mdash;had slipped one half of it back
on its head like a calash, and allowed the other half to
remain under its chin. It is easy to identify by its appearance
and its song, and its habit of living in the lower
parts of trees.</p>
<p>Eaton says: &ldquo;The nest of the Hooded Warbler is usually
placed in a low sapling or bush from 1 to 3 feet from
the ground. In my experience it is the easiest of all the
warbler nests to find. Wherever I have noticed a Hooded
warbler singing in a patch of woodland, I have been very
successful in locating the nest by placing my eye close
to the ground and looking through the shrubbery from below
the cover of the undergrowth. Then the nest will
almost surely be seen if one is within a few rods, appearing
like a bunch of leaves a short distance above the
ground.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>5. WILSON&rsquo;S WARBLER</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 5 inches.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Olive-green above, except for a <i>black crown, outlined
with yellow in front and at the sides of crown</i>; under
parts yellow, except for a grayish tinge at the sides;
wings and tail <i>without white bars</i> and <i>patches</i>.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Similar to male, but without a clearly defined black
cap.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A loud, sweet trill, containing variations.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Low thickets, usually at the edges of woods, rather
than in treetops.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern North America. Breeds in the tree-regions of
northern Canada south to southern Saskatchewan,
northern Minnesota, central Ontario, New Hampshire,
Maine, and Nova Scotia; winters in eastern
<span class="pb" id="Page_273">273</span>
Central America; migrates through the Alleghanies;
practically unknown from Virginia to Louisiana.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This attractive little warbler with its black cap might
easily be confused with the goldfinch by a beginner
in bird-study. The olive-green back, wings, and tail
differentiate it. Unlike the goldfinch, it is not a resident,
but a traveler to northern forests where it breeds. It
journeys enormous distances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appears very irregularly, some years in great abundance
and some seasons not at all.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_150" href="#fn_150">[150]</a></p>
<h2>6. THE BLACK-THROATED GREEN WARBLER</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 5 inches.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Olive-green above; dull black patch below eye, <i>encircled
with a broad rim of yellow</i>; <i>throat and breast black</i>,
becoming yellowish-white on the belly; sides streaked
with black; wings with two whitish bars; <i>tail with
outer feathers largely white</i>.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Similar to male; black of throat and breast mottled
with yellow, streaks on sides less conspicuous.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: An insect-like trill, <i>zee-zee? ze-ze-zee?</i></p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Coniferous woods preferably.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: North America, from central Canada to northern Ohio
and Long Island and in the Alleghany Mts., to
Georgia and South Carolina; winters from Mexico to
Panama.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For three summers I heard the persistent buzzing of
this little Black-throat in the Maine woods before I
was able to catch more than a fleeting glimpse of him.
He is very shy and elusive. An opportunity to see this
<span class="pb" id="Page_274">274</span>
beautiful little jeweled bird at close range is an event to
bird-lovers. He is an industrious gleaner of small insects
from dark pine and spruce forests.</p>
<h2>7. THE CANADIAN WARBLER</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 5&frac12; inches.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Gray above without white wing-bars or spots on tail;
crown with fine black spots; <i>eye-ring</i>, and <i>line from
bill to eye-ring bright yellow</i>; under parts bright
yellow; <i>short black streaks extending across the entire
breast</i>; white under tail.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Similar to male, with fainter streaks on breast.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A rapid and clear warble, more easily recognized than
that of some warblers.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: &ldquo;The Canadian Warbler during the migration season
is found about our door-yard shrubbery, and the
thickets on the edges of streams and woodland....
In the nesting season we must seek for it in cooler
gullies or in damp, cool woodlands of deciduous or
mixed growth.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_151" href="#fn_151">[151]</a></p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern North America. Breeds from south-central
Canada to central Minnesota, Michigan, New York,
and Massachusetts, and along the Alleghanies to
North Carolina and Tennessee; winters in Ecuador
and Peru.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>8. THE YELLOW-BREASTED CHAT</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 7&frac12; inches; the largest of the warblers.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: Olive-green above; bright yellow throat
and breast; belly white; <i>broad white streak extending
from bill above eye; white crescent beneath eye;
<span class="pb" id="Page_275">275</span>
white streak at each side of throat</i>, separating the
olive-green and yellow areas.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A medley impossible to describe, full of chucks and gurgles&mdash;a
strange mixture of sounds. As a singer, the
chat is in a class by himself; he is very different
from the other warblers.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Thickets and bushy pastures.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern United States; winters from Vera Cruz to
Panama.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following statements regarding the Chat are
taken from Eaton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Birds of New York&rdquo;:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chat is not a bird of the dense woodland or of
open situations, but is confined to thick coverts of shrubs,
vines, and young saplings, preferring a denser covert than
even the Chestnut-sided warbler and the Catbird. It is
rarely seen far from such situations....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though the Chat is so averse to being seen, he will sometimes
be found even within the limits of our villages and
cities where suitable thickets of considerable extent are
found and his loud song is frequently heard from village
streets and sidewalks.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>9. THE YELLOW PALM WARBLER</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 5&frac12; inches.</p>
<p><b>Male and Female</b>: <i>Crown chestnut; line over the eye and ring
around the eye yellow</i>; upper parts olive-green,
browner on the back; <i>under parts bright yellow, with
streaks of brown on throat, breast, and sides</i>; wings
sometimes edged with brown; tail edged with olive-green;
outer tail-feathers with white spots on inner
webs near tips.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: Two songs, one &ldquo;thinner&rdquo; and more rapid than the other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Fields and roadsides; feeds chiefly on the ground
and among low bushes.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Atlantic Slope of North America. Breeds in southeastern
Canada and Maine; winters from Louisiana
to northern Florida; casually to North Carolina and
Pennsylvania. The <span class="small">PALM WARBLER</span> is the western
species, an inhabitant of the Mississippi Valley and
the region eastward. It is very common in Florida,
where it may be discovered in company with yellow
Palm Warblers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This lively little warbler, with its nervous habit of
tipping up its tail incessantly like a spotted sandpiper,
resembles its near relative the yellow warbler in a
few respects. The olive-green upper parts and yellow
breast streaked with brown are points of resemblances,
but the chestnut crown and yellow line over the eye are
differences. Neither yellow warblers nor yellow palm
warblers are dwellers in the woods, but prefer to live near
the haunts of man. Yellow warblers are seen in trees
and bushes, while the palm warblers are found by roadsides,
often on the ground in the stubble of pastures, out in
the open. While subdued in color and therefore inconspicuous,
they are readily identified by the habit of moving
their tails.</p>
<h2>GROUP SIX&mdash;BLUE OR BLUE AND YELLOW WARBLERS</h2>
<h2>1. THE CERULEAN WARBLER</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 4&frac12; inches; one of the smaller warblers.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Upper parts bright blue; head and back streaked with
black; light streak above eye; white throat, breast,
<span class="pb" id="Page_277">277</span>
and belly, with a bluish-black line that extends across
the breast and down each side; wings with two broad
white bars; inner webs of all except the middle tail-feathers
with small white patches near tips.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Bluish-olive above, under parts pale yellow; light
streak over eye; wings with white bars; tail-feathers
with white tips.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: Mr. Stone describes the song of the Cerulean warbler
as &ldquo;an almost continuous &lsquo;<i>zwee-zwee, zwee, wee-ee</i>&rsquo;
during the nesting season.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_152" href="#fn_152">[152]</a></p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: &ldquo;They are numerous in the maple woods on the hillsides
overlooking the swamp, as well as in the swamp
itself,&rdquo; writes Mr. Stone.<a class="fn" href="#fn_152">[152]</a></p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern North America. Breeds mainly from southeastern
Nebraska, Minnesota, southern Michigan and
Ontario, western New York, Pennsylvania, and West
Virginia, south to Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>2. THE BLACK-THROATED BLUE WARBLER</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 5&frac14; inches.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Upper parts a <i>dull grayish-blue</i>, darker on the back,
black bordering crown above the eye; <i>cheeks, throat</i>,
and <i>upper breast black</i>; <i>belly white</i>; <i>sides black and
white</i>; wings black, edged with blue, and with white
next to body; <i>a white patch</i> on wing; tail bluish-black,
<i>outer feathers largely white</i>.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Very different from male; olive-green above, yellowish-white
underneath; light streak over eyes; <i>white
patch</i> near the base of the primary quills; tail bluish,
with much less white than on males.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: &ldquo;His song, though very versatile, is among the thinnest
and most non-melodious of the family.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fn_152">[152]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">278</div>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: &ldquo;Black-throated blue warblers prefer clearings
amidst hemlock woods or along hemlock-clad gully
banks where there are dense underbrush, bushes, and
stump sprouts bearing multitudes of large leaves.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fn_152">[152]</a></p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern North America from Hudson Bay and Newfoundland
south to the Northern States, and in the
highlands and mountains to Massachusetts, Connecticut,
Pennsylvania, and Maryland.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Black-throated Blue Warbler, though not so brilliantly
colored as many members of the family, is
one of the neatest and best-groomed of all the warblers.
As he flies from bough to bough or bush to bush he displays
to fine advantage the clear black and white coloration,
the white spots on the wings and tail flashing like
the wings of a butterfly. He carries his wings and tail
partially spread somewhat in the manner of the Redstart....
The male is not so nervously active as many other
warblers....</p>
<p>&ldquo;This warbler&rsquo;s nest often contains an egg of the Cowbird.
The nests are variously attached to slender scrubby
bushes, 8 to 30 inches up, usually very close to old trails
or old wood roads.... A constant characteristic of this
warbler&rsquo;s nest is the decoration of decayed, spongy pieces
of light colored wood fastened to the outside.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fn_152">[152]</a></p>
<h2>3. THE BLUE-WINGED WARBLER</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 5 inches.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Crown and under parts bright yellow; a black line
through the eye; back olive-green, yellower at the
rump; <i>wings bluish-gray</i>, edged with olive and white;
<span class="pb" id="Page_279">279</span>
<i>two broad yellowish-white wing-bars</i>; tail bluish-gray,
with white patches of different sizes on outer
feathers.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Similar to male, but with less yellow on head,&mdash;on
forehead and not on crown.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: &ldquo;The song is insignificant, a wheezy performance of
notes resembling the syllables &lsquo;<i>swee-e-e-e-e, chee-chee-chee-chee</i>,&rsquo;
the first inhaled, the second exhaled.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fn_152">[152]</a></p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: &ldquo;The Blue-winged warbler frequents swampy thickets
but is sometimes found among the scrubby second
growth of the hillsides and the undergrowth of dense
woods.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fn_152">[152]</a></p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Breeds in eastern North America from southeastern
Minnesota, southern Michigan, western New York,
Connecticut, and Massachusetts, southward to Missouri,
Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware; winters
from southern Mexico to Colombia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Blue-winged Warbler is deliberate in its movements
as compared with other warblers, acting
more like a vireo than a member of its family.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">&middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot; &middot;</span></p>
<p>The nesting site of this warbler is on the ground in a
bunch of herbs or at the foot of a small bush. The nest
is surrounded by grass, weeds, ferns, or vines, which
screen it effectively from view.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fn_152">[152]</a></p>
<h2>4. THE GOLDEN-WINGED WARBLER</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: A little over 5 inches.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: <i>Crown bright yellow</i>; white line over eye, <i>broad black
line extending through eye</i>; <i>black throat bordered
with white</i>; wings bluish-gray, with a <i>large, bright
yellow patch</i>; upper parts, bluish-gray; under parts,
<span class="pb" id="Page_280">280</span>
except throat, grayish-white; tail bluish-gray, with
outer feathers nearly all white on their inner webs.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Similar to male, but duller; cheeks and throat <i>dark
gray</i> instead of black.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: &ldquo;Its song is a &lsquo;lazy <i>zee-zee-zee</i>.&rsquo; It has also an insect-like
call-note, and a sharp <i>chip</i> alarm-note like that
of the chipping sparrow.... The song when near

zee-u-ee&prime;</i>.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_153" href="#fn_153">[153]</a></p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: The beautiful little Golden-winged Warbler may be
found in deciduous forests, especially among elm
and birch trees, and has a habit of seeking the ends
of branches for its food.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern North America. Breeds from central Minnesota,
southern Ontario, and Massachusetts, to southern
Iowa, northern Illinois, Indiana, and New Jersey,
and northern Georgia; winters from Guatemala to
Colombia; very rare in Florida and southern Georgia,
and west of the Mississippi.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>5. THE NORTHERN PARULA WARBLER</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: A little less than 5 inches.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Grayish-blue above, with a <i>bright olive-yellow patch
in the middle of the back</i>; <i>yellow throat and breast,
with a dark bluish or reddish-brown band across the
breast</i>; belly white; sides sometimes reddish-brown;
two white wing-bars; tail gray, edged with blue, with
white spots near tips of inner webs.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Similar to male, except that the reddish-brown markings
and band across the breast are less distinct or
wanting.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: A &ldquo;buzzing&rdquo; song rather evenly accented.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: &ldquo;During the migration season, the Parula Warbler
may be found among the foliage of our shade trees
<span class="pb" id="Page_281">281</span>
and orchards, being most common about the time
of the apple-blossoms. As soon as he reaches his
summer home, however, he is practically confined
to swamps ... preferring, during the nesting season
evergreen trees, although occasionally found in
mixed groves where deciduous trees predominate.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_154" href="#fn_154">[154]</a>
He lives in localities where he can find the <i>Usnea</i>
moss, in which he loves to build his nest. Look for
him along streams or near swamps where this moss
hangs from the trees.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: From eastern Nebraska and Minnesota, central Ontario,
Anticosti and Cape Breton Islands, south to
Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Virginia, and Maryland;
winters probably in the Bahamas and from Vera
Cruz to Nicaragua.</p>
<p class="bq">The southern species or <span class="small">PARULA WARBLER</span>, differs
slightly from his northern relative; his throat is yellower
and his breast-band is less distinct. He lives
in the southeastern United States, and is common
where there are cypresses hung with moss. He is
very active; he reminds one of the kinglet and the
chickadee as he hangs head downward from a spray,
seeking the tiny insects that he likes to eat.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>GROUP SEVEN&mdash;WARBLERS WITH REDDISH-BROWN MARKINGS</h2>
<h2>1. THE BAY-BREASTED WARBLER</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: A little over 5&frac12; inches.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: <i>Forehead</i> and <i>cheeks black</i>, giving the effect of a <i>black
mask</i>; <i>crown, nape, throat, upper breast</i>, and <i>sides</i>
a beautiful chestnut-red; a patch of buff at each side
of the neck; lower breast and belly buff; back brownish-gray,
<span class="pb" id="Page_282">282</span>
with black streaks; wings and tail brownish-gray;
two broad white wing-bars; tail with white
spots near tip of outer feathers.</p>
<p><b>Female</b>: Upper parts grayish-brown, streaked with black; under
parts buff, breast and sides washed with reddish-brown;
crown brownish; two white wing-bars.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: &ldquo;A monotonous, lisping song, with perhaps a few more
musical, ringing notes.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_155" href="#fn_155">[155]</a></p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: &ldquo;The Bay-breasted warbler usually frequents the
tops of trees during migration, being especially fond
of chestnuts, oaks, and hickories just as the leaves
are bursting. It is also found in orchards and about
the shade trees of streets and parks as well as in
the midst of woodlands.... It prefers the upper
portions of trees except in cold or stormy weather
when it descends and feeds among the underbrush.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_156" href="#fn_156">[156]</a>
William Brewster says that they live in dense woods,
especially among the pines and other cone-bearing
trees.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern North America. Breeds in north-central and
southern Canada, northern Maine, and mountains of
New Hampshire; winters in Panama and Colombia;
irregular on the Atlantic slope and south of Virginia.
One of our less common warblers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>2. THE CHESTNUT-SIDED WARBLER</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Length</b>: About 5 inches.</p>
<p><b>Male</b>: Crown <i>yellow</i>, bordered with black; back gray, streaked
with black and yellow; <i>ear-patch and under parts
white</i>; black line extending from bill meets <i>broad
chestnut streak</i> which runs down the side of the
body; wings with two broad yellowish-white wing-bars;
tail black, outer feathers with large white
spots varying in size.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">283</div>
<p><b>Female</b>: Somewhat like male, but duller; the colors are less
sharply contrasted.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: In the spring a loud warble, not unlike that of the
yellow warbler; in the summer, a weaker trill.<a class="fn" id="fr_157" href="#fn_157">[157]</a></p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Thickets, bushy roadsides, edges of woods, open
woodlands.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Eastern North America from central Canada to eastern
Nebraska, northern Ohio, New Jersey, Rhode Island,
and Massachusetts, and in the Alleghany Mts.
to Tennessee and North Carolina.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The male Chestnut-sided Warbler is very easily
identified; its sharp contrasts in coloring make it
conspicuous. While the bay-breasted warbler also has
chestnut sides, it differs in having the color extend to the
breast and throat, instead of bordering the white under
parts.</p>
<p>The dainty little chestnut-sided warbler is rather commoner
than some species. Dr. F. H. Herrick in his book,
&ldquo;The Home Life of Wild Birds,&rdquo; tells of taming a female.
She ate from his hand and allowed him to stroke her as
she sat on her nest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">284</div>
<h2>THE THRUSHES
<br /><i>Thrush Family&mdash;Turdid&aelig;</i></h2>
<p>Six members of the Thrush Family are more or less
common in the eastern United States: the Robin, the
Bluebird, the Wood Thrush, the Hermit Thrush, the Olive-backed
Thrush, and the Veery. The Gray-cheeked and
Bicknell&rsquo;s thrushes are not so widely known. The Russet-backed
Thrush is the western representative of the
Olive-back.</p>
<p>The Oven-bird, or Golden-crowned Thrush, and the
Water-thrushes are not thrushes at all, but warblers,
though they resemble thrushes in having brown backs and
light spotted breasts, and in being dwellers of the woods.
The Brown Thrasher, sometimes wrongly called the
Brown Thrush, also has points of resemblance&mdash;a speckled
breast and bright brown back&mdash;but he is one of the Mimid&aelig;
or Mockingbird Family.</p>
<p>The breasts of young robins and the backs of baby
bluebirds are spotted, showing their family relationship.
Both robins and bluebirds have voices that possess a quality
for which our thrushes are noted. I have heard the
English thrush, famed in poetry. I consider its song inferior
in quality of tone to those of our wood and hermit-thrushes,
and veery; it strongly resembles that of our
thrasher.</p>
<p>The true thrushes of our woods have backs of leaf-brown,
varying in hue from bright russet to dull olive.
Their breasts are white or buff, streaked or spotted; their
tails are short; their eyes, large and lustrous. Their
movements are quick, yet graceful. Their demeanor is
gentle, though I have seen them strongly aroused when
nest or young was disturbed.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_285">285</div>
<h3>THE WOOD THRUSH</h3>
<p>The Wood Thrush is the best known of these thrushes.
It may be identified by <i>its large size</i> (a little over 8
inches); by its <i>bright brown head</i>, dull brown back, wings,
and tail; white under parts that are <i>heavily spotted, especially
on the breast and sides</i>; and by distinct streaks
below the eyes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Note</b>: Its call-note is a sharp <i>pit</i>; its song a series of sweet
cadences beginning with the liquid syllables <i>ah-oh-ee</i>?</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: Four phrases often constitute the song, between
which a soft purring sound is frequently
heard, if one is near the singer.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: Wood thrushes may be found in open groves, parks,
and wooded pastures, on large estates, and along
secluded roads. They are rarely found near farm-buildings,
but occasionally live in gardens and orchards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A pair of thrushes once nested in a tree on a slope
just back of a house where I chanced to be a guest. The
mother-bird had begun her brooding, when carpenters
arrived to build some steps near her chosen home. Frightened,
she fled, and remained away for a time. Finally
mother-love overcame her fears and she returned. The
workmen were asked to do her no harm; they became interested
in her, and she trustful of them. She let them approach
<span class="pb" id="Page_286">286</span>
within a few feet of her nest. We saw the shy
wood-bird, serene and unafraid, raise her brood in the
midst of noisy hammering, with friendly companionship
close at hand.</p>
<h3>THE OLIVE-BACKED THRUSH</h3>
<p>The Olive-backed Thrush is about an inch smaller
than the wood thrush (7 inches), and is uniformly
<i>olive-brown above</i>. Its <i>breast, throat, cheeks</i>, and <i>eye-ring</i>
are <i>buff</i>; its <i>sides gray</i>. The breast, sides of the
throat, and cheeks are spotted with black.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Note</b>: Its call-note is <i>puck</i>;</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: its song pleasing, with a
phrasing that reminds one of the hermit thrush, but
it is louder and less deliberate, and lacks, also, the
hermit&rsquo;s liquid sweetness. The olive-back has a habit
of singing from the pointed top of a tall spruce;
near by, on a neighboring treetop, an olive-sided
flycatcher may utter its <i>Peep here</i>, or a hermit may
sing in the grove below.</p>
<p><b>Habitat</b>: The olive-back lives in woods, rather than close to
the haunts of man; it prefers to be near streams and
swampy places, as does the western <span class="small">RUSSET-BACK
THRUSH</span>, a bird very similar in appearance and habits.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: The olive-back breeds in Canada and northern United
States, and winters from Mexico to South America.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>THE GRAY-CHEEKED THRUSH AND BICKNELL&rsquo;S THRUSHES</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Gray-Cheeked Thrush</b>: &ldquo;The Gray-cheeked Thrush is found
in migration over all the Eastern States, but breeds
farther north, beyond our limits.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">287</div>
<p><b>Bicknell&rsquo;s Thrush</b>: &ldquo;Bicknell&rsquo;s Thrush, a closely related
form, while having somewhat the same general
range, breeds farther south and nests in the mountains
of northern New York and New England. The
species does not seem to be very abundant anywhere.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_158" href="#fn_158">[158]</a></p>
<p class="bq">Their resemblance to each other and to the olive-back
makes them difficult to identify. The absence
of buff from the head differentiates them from the
latter species, which is a difference not readily observed
except by experienced ornithologists. Bicknell&rsquo;s
thrush is smaller than the gray-cheeked thrush.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>THE VEERY</h3>
<p>The Veery or Wilson&rsquo;s Thrush is slightly smaller than
the wood thrush (7&frac12; inches), and is a <i>lighter and
more uniform brown above</i>. It has a whitish throat and
belly, and <i>grayish sides</i>. The breast and sides of the
throat are a soft buff, with faint spots of brown. Its
light brown upper parts and its less conspicuous markings
distinguish the veery from other thrushes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Note</b>: Its call-note is a whistled <i>whee&prime;-u</i>,&mdash;loud, clear, and uttered frequently.</p>
<p><b>Song</b>: The song is inexpressibly beautiful,&mdash;like organ-chords,
or those that fill the Baptistery of Pisa when the
Italian guide blends tones for the delight of listeners.
A veery&rsquo;s song cannot be described; the <i>whee&prime;-u</i> may
reveal the singer&rsquo;s whereabouts, and aid in identification.
This bird has brought me pleasure many
times, for it forms one of the chorus that sing their
matin- and even-songs in a spruce grove across the
road from our cottage in Maine. Still other veeries
chant with hermit thrushes in more distant woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">288</div>
<p class="bq">It recalls, also, memories of deep Adirondack
woods near Seventh Lake, where we heard veeries
and wood thrushes sing antiphonally at sunset.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: This thrush is abundant in the eastern United States
during its migration, while on the way to its nesting
place in our Northern States, to New England, and
Canada. It winters in South America.</p>
<p class="bq">It seems to bear a charmed life. It does no harm
and receives none; it is a favorite wherever its
voice is heard.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>THE HERMIT THRUSH</h3>
<p>The Hermit Thrush may be described in superlatives.
Of the four commoner thrushes, it comes earliest
(in March or early April) on its way to its haunts in
northern woods, remains longest (till October or November),
and is considered by many to be the finest singer
of a highly gifted family.</p>
<p>It is so very shy that it is rarely seen and yet, during
migration time, I once discovered a solitary hermit in a
tree on a vacant lot only a few blocks from the business
center of Cleveland. Because we sit quietly for hours
at a time in the Maine woods, we have been vouchsafed
many glimpses of its olive-brown back, <i>its reddish-brown
tail</i> (the mark of identification), and its rather thickly
spotted white and brown breast. We have noticed its
habit of raising its tail as it alighted; we have heard its
call-note <i>chuck</i>.</p>
<p>Moore&rsquo;s Rock, Castine, Maine, commands an enchanting
view of Penobscot Bay, of distant hills, and of spruce
woods that are tenanted by veeries, olive-backed, and
hermit thrushes. There we make frequent pilgrimages,
to hear them sing at sunset.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">289</div>
<p>Beneath glowing skies and in the silence, the hermit
raises his exquisitely modulated voice in a strain of ethereal
beauty; pauses, then in a higher key, repeats it;
a third time, with still loftier elevation of tone, he sings,&mdash;and
sings again.</p>
<p>More than once at twilight, a white fog has moved in
from the bay and enveloped us as we listened. The
voices of these thrushes, proceeding from the sea of mist,
have seemed more like those of spirits from another world
than of birds&mdash;unspeakably uplifting and full of significance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">290</div>
<h2 id="c11">AFTERWORD</h2>
<p>The great psychologist, William James, preached
the doctrine that it was immoral to have emotions
that did not bear fruit in action,&mdash;a doctrine that many
educators and teachers are putting into practice nowadays.</p>
<p>Music, art, noble architecture, poetry, fine prose, the
drama, and the beauties of nature, all of which arouse
the emotion of joy and minister to our higher natures,
were formerly sought as means of self-development or culture&mdash;one
of the great ends to be attained in life. Excessive
cultivation of one&rsquo;s self is now regarded by broad-minded
people as a refined form of selfishness (often intellectual
snobbishness), unless with it there exists a sense
of responsibility and an attempt to assist in making possible
by some form of activity a more nearly universal
sharing of these pure forms of pleasure.</p>
<p>The conservation of forests, the preservation of scenic
wonders, of wild flowers, of native animals and birds for
the enjoyment of all, has become the aim of a great movement
throughout the country. It is well known that the
fine balance of nature is maintained by birds, and that
upon them depend in large measure the preservation of
forests, parks, gardens, orchards, and farms.</p>
<p>As they are so truly our benefactors and furnish us
with so much genuine enjoyment and absorbing interest,
we are under obligation to repay their services to us by
some form of service to them, which will minister also to
the well-being of our communities.  The formation of
<span class="pb" id="Page_291">291</span>
Audubon Societies, the spreading of knowledge by means
of bird-books, illustrated bird-lectures, and the invaluable
bulletins easily obtainable at the Government Printing
Office, Washington; the erection of bird-houses and
baths, and of feeding-tables for the winter; the furthering
of wise legislation regarding bird-protection and the supplying
of bird-wardens in some localities to help carry out
the laws; intelligent and humane regulations to prevent the
depredations of cats; the creation, wherever possible, of
bird-sanctuaries and preserves, and the planting of trees
and shrubs which will attract birds are a few of the ways
in which we may make practical our interest in birds and
add to the well-being of our land.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
